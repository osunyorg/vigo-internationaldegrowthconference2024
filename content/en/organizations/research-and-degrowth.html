summary: >-
  An academic association dedicated to research, awareness-raising, and events organization around the topic of degrowth. R&amp;D defines degrowth as a multi-level voluntary path towards reduction of production and consumption aiming at ecological sustainability, good life, liberty, and social justice. For R&amp;D, degrowth is grounded in ecology, ecological economics, anthropology, psychology, and social sciences in general. In the degrowth process, R&amp;D is concerned with democracy, international cooperation, and understanding as opposed to societal closure, fragmentation, and authoritarianism.
