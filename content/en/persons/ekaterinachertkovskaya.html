biography: >-
  <p>              Ekaterina Chertkovskaya is a researcher based at Lund University (Sweden), working on degrowth and critical organisation studies. Her work addresses the crises created by capitalism, neoliberalism and the pursuit of economic growth, and explores paths for socio-ecological transformation. She has been writing on corporate violence, problems with work/employability and the plastic crisis, on the one hand. On the other, she has been focusing on degrowth as a vision for transformation, its political economy and strategies, as well as alternative modes of organisation and work.  Ekaterina co-edited <i>Degrowth &amp; Strategy</i><i> </i>(MayFly 2022, open access) and <i>Towards a Political Economy of Degrowth</i> (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2019), and co-organised the 6<sup>th</sup> International Degrowth Conference (Malmö, 2018). She is committed to not-for-profit open access and alternatives to mainstream publishing and has since 2012 been a member of the editorial collective of  <i>ephemera: theory &amp; politics in organization.</i></p>
