<p>I am a Postdoctoral researcher on the PROSPERA project. My research explores how space, language and images influence systems and behaviour. I come to PROSPERA from a multidisciplinary and historic perspective. I hold a PhD from the University of Cambridge, completed in the context of the <a href="https://impanccit.wixsite.com/impanccit">'Impact of the Ancient City' project (ERC, Horizon 2020)</a>. My doctoral thesis showed how modern urban planning of the nineteenth century was enabled by archaeological excavations, and reshaped the image of Greco-Roman antiquity in turn. I have published on public health, water theory, orthogonal planning, and utopia. I adopt a creative and interdisciplinary research philosophy informed by my own <a href="http://www.sofiagreaves.online/">artistic practice</a>.Over the next three years I will investigate the importance of urban planning to realising a post-growth future. Cities are essential to a post-growth future, but urban development frameworks - no matter how 'green' or 'circular' they are - remain oriented towards economic growth. Please contact me if you are interested in discussing this subject!</p>
