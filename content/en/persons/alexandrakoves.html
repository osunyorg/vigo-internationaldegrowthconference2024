<p>Alexandra Köves is an ecological economist, associate professor at the Corvinus University of Budapest in the Department of Decision Sciences and head of the Ecological Economics Research Centre at the Corvinus Institute for Advanced studies. She teaches subjects related to decision sciences, ecological economics, and Degrowth. Her research focuses partly on decisions influencing sustainability transitions, and partly on sustainability scenarios using participatory research techniques. She graduated with an MA in International Business and Languages from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland in 1999. Her MPhil degree is from the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna. She received her PhD from the Corvinus University of Budapest in 2015, having worked on the topic of sustainable employment within the field of ecological economics. In the first decade of her career, she worked with development programmes in the fields of employment policy, social integration, vocational training, adult- and higher education. After having realised that what we call development currently is neither sustainable, nor socially just, in 2011 she turned towards re-examining the theoretical principles in academia. She joined Corvinus as a faculty member in 2014. Since then, she has become an advocate of ecological economics in Hungary trying to introduce this research field to both students and a wider audience, running a podcast series called “Green Equality” with now over 150 episodes. She is also host of the English-language podcast of the European Society of Ecological Economics called Economics for Rebels. Since the 1<sup>st</sup> of January 2022, she is vice-president of the European Society of Ecological Economics.</p>
