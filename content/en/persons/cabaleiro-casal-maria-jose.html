biography: >-
  <p>María Jose is an Associated Professor at University of Vigo. Her work focuses on Cooperatives, firms that promote social values such as democracy and equality.  Her latest research focuses on to what extent stakeholders’ behavior meets such values addressing economic and financial objectives at the same time. She is currently involved in the project SAVES which aims to make economic and financial information of coops in Galicia (Spain) accessible to the public, and to promote research on Cooperatives and Social Economy. The first results are already available at <a href="https://saves.uvigo.gal" target="_blank">https://saves.uvigo.gal<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>.</p><p><b>mcasal[at]uvigo.gal</b></p>
