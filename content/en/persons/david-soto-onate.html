biography: >-
  <p>David Soto-Oñate, PhD is a Postdoc researcher at the University       of Vigo (Post-growth Innovation Lab and ECOBAS). Previously, he       was a Fulbright researcher at the Ostrom Workshop (Indiana       University) for two years. From the perspectives of Institutional       and Ecological Economics, David has published research works on a       variety of topics in the fields of economic development and the       sustainable governance of resources (fisheries, climate change,       circular economy, and oil transport). His main current research       endeavor revolves around the polycentric governance of a       postgrowth social order. He is also PI of the project <a href="https://postgrowth-lab.webs.uvigo.es/arca/" target="_blank">ARCA </a>(Towards an Appropriate Climate Responsibility) funded by the       Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation. </p><p><b>davidsoto[at]uvigo.gal</b></p>
