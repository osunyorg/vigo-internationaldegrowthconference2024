biography: >-
  <p>Dr. Samer Abdelnour is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh Business School, where he also directs the MSc in Global Strategy and Sustainability. His research explores how enterprise and household energy (cookstove) interventions in postwar and humanitarian contexts influence new forms of organizing for societal transitions. Samer also served as a national expert on the ISO process to develop a global standard for clean cookstoves. His recent work examines the link between innovation ecosystems and violence.  </p>
