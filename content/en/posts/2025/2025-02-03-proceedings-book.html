    <p>  <br>ESEE-Degrowth 2024 Proceedings & Abstracts</p>  <p>   <br>Ecological <br>Economics and Degrowth have become vibrant and well-established communities, increasingly <br>attracting scholars from diverse backgrounds and ages. In this context, the <br>Pontevedra 2024 conference aimed to serve as a gathering point for members of <br>both fields, fostering dialogue and exchange among the various contributors to <br>these dynamic areas of study. Currently, modern science faces a fundamental and <br>ultimately paradoxical situation: while an increasing number of scientists <br>question the endless pursuit of growth and refute its imaginary, the majority <br>of science, technology and innovation (STI) institutions are transitioning <br>towards a model that increasingly favours and funds applied research to boost <br>economic growth. From engineering to applied sciences, the practice and <br>discourse surrounding STI has been instrumental to align knowledge production <br>with endless capitalist expansion. Therefore, a society beyond growth must <br>learn how to articulate new imaginaries and relations between society and the <br>institutions of science, technology and innovation.  When we <br>designed the Pontevedra 2024 conference, we felt need to decouple STI from the <br>pursuit of endless growth, and yet not enough reflection has been put into this <br>important task. By and large, conversations about how to repurpose STI as <br>socio-political phenomena, and decouple it from the instrumental purposes of <br>capitalist accumulation have been held at the margins of Ecological Economics <br>and Degrowth. We think it is about time to move this conversation to the centre <br>and encourage a more open engagement with colleagues in other disciplines. It <br>was in this context that we proposed the overarching theme ‘Technology, Science <br>and innovation beyond growth’ as an open invitation to engage with other <br>scholarly traditions that problematise technological imaginaries and practices, <br>even if they have not yet made the explicit connection with degrowth debates. <br>This conference provided a timely opportunity to build new bridges between <br>scholars focusing on the ways in which power and politics shape science and <br>technology, and vice versa.  It is also <br>worth noting that, for the first time, such an event was held in a small town <br>like Pontevedra, with just over 80,000 residents, rather than a large city. <br>While this presented significant organizational challenges, it also contributed <br>to making this edition one of the most successful in terms of participation. <br>After months of hard work, the event drew over 1,200 participants and featured <br>7 plenary dialogues, 227 parallel sessions with more than 740 presentations, <br>and 33 free, public activities both before and during the conference. As the <br>chair of this event, I am immensely proud of the team that made this success <br>possible and deeply grateful to the European Society for Ecological Economics <br>and the Degrowth Support Group for entrusting us with this endeavour.  </p>  <p> Pontevedra, September 10th   <br>Mario Pansera   <br>Conference Chair</p>
