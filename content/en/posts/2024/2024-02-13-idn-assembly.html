        <p>Assemblies are the space for degrowthers, activists, practitioners, researchers, artists, IDN members, and allies to meet and exchange on how best to collaborate and spread degrowth ideas, policies and practices. Importantly, Assemblies are also a space to connect and share convivial experiences.</p><p>This year’s Assembly will focus on building on what was started in Zagreb - that is to say, structuring actors and organisations of the degrowth movement in a more cohesive, collaborative and coherent manner. There will, of course, be room for conversations, debates and feedback on the direction, structure, and functioning that the IDN is taking, as well as time for the movement to connect, share, laugh and strategise.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>General Information</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Date &amp; Time: </b>17th of June, 2024. Plan for a full day (CET) of activities and convivial moments!</p><p><b>Participants</b>: Anyone belonging to the degrowth movement, who identifies as an ally, or who is interested in participating may attend. The IDN recommends that each member group (see a list of member groups <a href="https://degrowth.net/organisations/" target="_blank">here</a>) sends two participants on its behalf.</p><p><b>Registration: </b>We will open registration two months before the Assembly. Mark your calendars, nonetheless.</p><p><b>Location</b>: Pazo da Cultura, Pontevedra. The video conference link will be shared with registrants closer to the time.</p><p><b>Programme</b>: To be announced.

We will do our best to ensure all accessibility needs and dietary restrictions are met.</p><p><b>Contact and further information: </b>Please reach out to info[at]degrowth. net for any questions, concerns, or suggestions. More information and updates will be published on the IDN’s <a href="https://degrowth.net/" target="_blank">website</a> later on and will also be shared on the Degrowth World <a href="https://degrowth.info/en/stay-updated" target="_blank">mailinglist</a>.
