    5th Assembley International Degrowth Movement
  summary: >-
    <p>The 5th International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement will convene on June 17th in a hybrid format, online and in Pontevedra. For the first time, the Assembly is organised by the IDN.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Assemblies are the space for degrowthers, activists, <br>practitioners, researchers, artists, IDN members, and allies to meet and <br>exchange on how best to collaborate and spread degrowth ideas, policies and <br>practices. Importantly, Assemblies are also a space to connect and share <br>convivial experiences. This year’s Assembly will focus on <br>building on what was started in Zagreb - that is to say, structuring actors and <br>organisations of the degrowth movement in a more cohesive, collaborative and <br>coherent manner. There will, of course, be room for conversations, debates and <br>feedback on the direction, structure, and functioning that the IDN is taking, <br>as well as time for the movement to connect, share, laugh and strategise. General Information Date & Time:  17th <br>of June, 2024. Plan for a full day (CET) of activities and convivial moments! Participants : <br>Anyone belonging to the degrowth movement, who identifies as an ally, or who is <br>interested in participating may attend. The IDN recommends that each member <br>group (see a list of member groups  here ) sends two participants on its behalf. Registration:  We <br>will open registration two months before the Assembly. Mark your calendars, <br>nonetheless. Location : <br>Pazo da Cultura, Pontevedra. The video conference link will be shared with <br>registrants closer to the time. Programme : <br>To be announced. Note that the Assembly will spread throughout the day (likely <br>10:00 - 18:00) and that working sessions will alternate with convivial breaks, <br>lunch, guided brainstorms and collective discussions. Catering:  Lunch, <br>hot beverages and snacks will be provided to participants free of charge. We <br>will do our best to ensure all accessibility needs and dietary restrictions are <br>met. Contact and further information:  Please <br>reach out to info[at]degrowth. net for any questions, concerns, or suggestions. <br>More information and updates will be published on the IDN’s  website  later <br>on and will also be shared on the Degrowth World  mailinglist . To learn about the history of the <br>Degrowth Movement Assemblies, see this article on  Degrowth. info . </p>  <p>  </p>
