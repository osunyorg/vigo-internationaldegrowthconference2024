        <p>A week after the end of the 15th Conference of the European Society for Ecological Economics (ESEE) and the 10th International Degrowth Conference, we take stock of everything that happened at this event, leaving us (the local hosts) with a very good feeling here at the <a href="https://postgrowth-lab.uvigo.es/" target="_blank">Post-Growth Innovation Lab<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> of the University of Vigo.</p><p>With an attendance of <b>more than 1100 people from 48 different countries</b>, it was one of the most well-attended meetings to date, with the participation of academics, activists and, for the first time in this type of conference, students and teachers of secondary education.</p><p>Although the official start of the Conference was on June 18, the activities began on the previous Monday with the celebration of the <b><a href="https://esee-degrowth2024.uvigo.gal/en/the-conference/phd-symposium/" target="_blank">PhD Symposium<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a></b>, which was attended by 40 predoctoral researchers. On Tuesday 18th, the <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/oQ_IEzlEkhw?si=9WpzwRPOxVOUu6TU" target="_blank">Opening Session<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a></b> took place in the Pazo de la Cultura de Pontevedra, where Mario Pansera, the main organiser of the event, together with the president of the European Society for Ecological Economics, Dan O'Neill, and the representatives of the international degrowth Supporting Group, Vincent Liegey and Brototi Roi, were in charge of welcoming the participants in a completely full auditorium. During this session, the first two plenary presentations also took place, which this year took the form of dialogues.
