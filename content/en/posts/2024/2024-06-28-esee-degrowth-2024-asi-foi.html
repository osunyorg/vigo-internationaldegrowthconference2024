  summary: >-
    <p>Six days with more than 220 sessions and social activities, and a participation of more than 1100 attendees. </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>A week after the end of the 15th <br>Conference of the European Society for Ecological Economics (ESEE) and the 10th <br>International Degrowth Conference, we take stock of everything that happened at <br>this event, leaving us (the local hosts) with a very good feeling here at the <br> Post-Growth Innovation Lab  of the University of Vigo. With an attendance of  more than <br>1100 people from 48 different countries , it was one of the most well-attended meetings <br>to date, with the participation of academics, activists and, for the first time <br>in this type of conference, students and teachers of secondary education. Although the official start of the <br>Conference was on June 18, the activities began on the previous Monday with the <br>celebration of the  PhD Symposium , which was attended by 40 predoctoral <br>researchers. On Tuesday 18th, the  Opening Session  took place in the Pazo de la <br>Cultura de Pontevedra, where Mario Pansera, the main organiser of the event, <br>together with the president of the European Society for Ecological Economics, <br>Dan O'Neill, and the representatives of the international degrowth Supporting <br>Group, Vincent Liegey and Brototi Roi, were in charge of welcoming the <br>participants in a completely full auditorium. During this session, the first <br>two plenary presentations also took place, which this year took the form of <br>dialogues. The first of these, entitled " STS in the context of degrowth:science and technology in the era of colonial capitalist expansion ", featured <br>Samer Abdelnour (University of Edinburgh) and Annapurna Mamidipudi (Technical <br>University of Berlin) and was moderated by Tess Doezema (Universitat Autónoma <br>de Barcelona). In the second, with the title " Introduction to EcologicalEconomics and Degrowth ", which will be part of the podcast  Economics <br>for Rebels , Joshua Farley (University of Vermont), Giorgos Kallis <br>(Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona), and Brototi Roy (Universitat Autónoma de <br>Barcelona) participated, with the moderation of the podcast director Alexandra <br>Köves (Corvinus University of Budapest). The Opening Session ended with a <br> concert by the pianist Abe Rábade , who filled the Pazo de la Cultura with <br>magic, performing songs from his album  Botánica , accompanied by the <br>musicians and dancers who participated in this work. Wednesday 19 June saw the start of <br>the more than 220 parallel sessions of this edition, spread over four different <br>venues between the University Campus of A Xunqueira and the Pazo de la Cultura. <br>This first day of sessions also included the third plenary dialogue, " Thepolitics of materials and the plastic industry ", with the participation of <br>Ekaterina Chertkovskaya (Lund University) and Alice Mah (University of Glasgow) <br>and the moderation of Vincenzo Pavone (CSIC), and the General Assembly of the <br>European Society for Ecological Economics (ESEE).  On Thursday 20, the parallel <br>sessions continued and dialogues 4 and 5 were held. The first, entitled <br>" What Circular Economy? ", featured the expertise of Kersty Hobson <br>(University of Cardiff) and Hans-Christian Eberl (responsible for the Circular <br>Economy in the European Commission's Horizon Europe programme), and was led by <br>Andrea Genovese (Sheffield University Management School). The fifth dialogue <br>was entitled " Technology and Democracy: The Right to RepairMovement ", with Javier Lloveras (Post-Growth Innovation Lab) as chair and <br>with the participation of Ugo Vallauri (Co-Founder and Co-Director of The <br>Restart Project) & Blanca Callén (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona).  The last two plenary dialogues took <br>place on the last day of the conference, Friday 21 June. In the first one, <br>" Rethinking Innovation: Alternative approaches for people andplanet ", the theme of innovation was addressed by Alejandra Boni (Ingenio <br>- UPV), Adrian Smith (University of Sussex) and Andrea Jiménez (University of <br>Sheffield), under the baton of Aviram Sharma (Post-Growth Innovation Lab). The <br>last dialogue, " Climate Change and Degrowth " was led by researcher <br>Mario Pansera (Post-Growth Innovation Lab) and addressed the topic of climate <br>change with two leading figures, Julia Steinberger (University of Lausanne) and <br>Carlo Buontempo (Director of Copernicus Climate Service of the IU). The Conference also included an ambitious <br> social programme  developed between Monday 17th and Saturday 22nd June with more <br>than 20 activities in Galician, Spanish and English, and with artistic and <br>cultural events, such as film and documentary screenings, dance performances, <br>or a collective mural, among others. The program closed with a concert featuring <br>several musical groups, and the celebration of a great  Queimada  with <br>live traditional music.  The preparations for the next meeting <br>-- the  18th Conference of the International Society for Ecological Economicsand the 11th International Conference on Degrowth  -- are already underway. We <br>look forward to meeting you all again in Oslo (Norway) from 24 to 27 June 2025.  </p>  <p>  </p>
