        <p>OPENING CEREMONY <br>Dialogue 1: STS in the context of degrowth: science and technology in the era of colonial capitalist expansion</p><p>Tuesday 18 June 2024, 17.30h (Pazo da Cultura)<br>with Samer Abdelnour (The Univesity of Edimburg) &amp; Annapurna Mamidipudi (Technical University of Berlin), moderated by Tess Doezema (Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona).<br><br>What critical approaches to innovation can we mobilize to think with and for degrowth? Putting in conversation critiques from disparate sites that are not typically centered in conversations on innovation—the first being crafts and handloom weaving, and the second armed conflicts, militaries and war—we ask how we might look outside of our habits of thought and habits of theory to critique technoscience and its entanglements with the extant socioeconomic order.</p><p>Dialogue 2: Introduction to Ecological Economics and Degrowth</p><p>Tuesday 18 June 2024, 18.30h (Pazo da Cultura)<br>with Joshua Farley (University of Vermont), Giorgos Kallis (Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona) &amp; Brototi Roy (Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona), moderated by Alexandra Köves (Corvinus University of Budapest)<br><br>Degrowth, ecological economics, post-development. Concepts that relate to each other, overlap in terms of social goals, engagement and in many other perspectives. But how? And what are the differences? What is the story and the history behind them? Brototi Roy, Joshua Farley and Giorgos Kallis try to do the impossible and debate these questions in an hour at the opening plenary dialogue that is also going to be a live recording of an Economics for Rebels podcast. Hosted by Alexandra Köves.</p>
