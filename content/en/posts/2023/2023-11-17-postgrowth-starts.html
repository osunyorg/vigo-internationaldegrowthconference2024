        <p>The most outstanding feature of this unique project is that students in 3rd and 4th ESO and 1st year of Bacharelato will be able to get involved in a real science process within the framework of social sciences, a novel and unusual experience, a unique opportunity to involve citizens in citizen science processes and connect the scientific community with society.</p><p>This initiative aims to serve as a bridge between the ESEE-Decrecemento 2024 conference, to be held in Pontevedra next year, and the youngest people in the city. In this way, involving the students, we intend to establish a connection with these people, who will be the ones most affected if inaction in the face of environmental and social problems continues over time.</p><p>The project has the support of the Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología (FECYT), dependent on the Ministry of Science and Innovation.</p>
