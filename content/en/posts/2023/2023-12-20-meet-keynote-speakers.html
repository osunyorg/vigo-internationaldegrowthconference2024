    <p>  <br>We are already preparing the plenary sessions that will take place during the ESEE-Degrowth Conference 2024, which in this edition will take place in the format of dialogues on different hot topics related to degrowth and ecological economics. In each of these dialogues, two or three experts on the topic will share their knowledge and establish a dialogue and debate about it, in which the public will of course also be able to get involved. In the coming weeks, we will be revealing the names of the keynote speakers who will be participating in these sessions. Stay tuned!</p>
