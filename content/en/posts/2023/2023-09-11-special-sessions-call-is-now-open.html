        <p>Special Sessions aim to give space within the Conference to special tracks that are not among those proposed by the organization, sessions with a unique topic and format, or groups of people that want to present the progress or results of a specific project. We invite special sessions that provide artistic or interactive avenues to learn, debate, and co-create in transdisciplinary manners, such as dancing, futuring, visioning, painting, sculpture, songwriting, theatre, improv, poetry, backcasting, world cafés, board games, yoga and meditation etc.</p><p>Any person can submit a proposal for organizing a Special Session or propose a Special Track (topics related to degrowth and ecological economics but not clearly fitting with any of the <a href="https://esee-degrowth2024.uvigo.gal/en/the-conference/program/call-for-abstracts/tracks/" target="_blank">tracks</a> proposed by the conference organizers). The <b>deadline for submitting proposals is October 16, 2023</b>. </p>
