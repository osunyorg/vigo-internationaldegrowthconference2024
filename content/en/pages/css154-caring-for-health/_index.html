summary: >-
  Degrowth envisions societies overcoming resource depletion, uncontrolled pollution, climate catastrophe and biodiversity loss while promoting planetary regeneration, human well-being and autonomy in a post-capitalist future that entails less material consumption, particularly in the Global North. The concept of health is central to the idea of wellbeing in the degrowth framework but remains undefined and tied to surrogate parameters such as life expectancy, which, notably in high-income countries, are related to increased health expenditure and depend on GDP growth.<br><br>Hence, this proposal for a special session on health and care aims to discuss the constraints of modern growth-orientated biomedical health systems, debating the embedded logic that drives them and exploring alternative approaches towards health and care in a post-growth future.

        <p><b><i>Keynote lecture</i></b></p><p><b>Caring for health within planetary boundaries: Post-growth alternatives for health care systems</b></p><p>Speaker: Arianna Rotulo, Sustainable Health Department, Campus Fryslan, University of Groningen, The Netherlands</p><p><i>Health care services have become a multi-faceted industry that, besides the delivery of care itself, also includes pharmaceutical, medical devices and equipment industries, hospital construction, financial and governance structures, and providers of digital technologies. Expansion of health care represents a driver of soaring global health spending which also means that ever-enlarging parts of economic activity are directed towards health care systems. While health care is generally perceived as a service industry with a low environmental footprint, health care systems also cause underestimated ecological impacts and total greenhouse gas emissions from health care can amount up to 10% of national emissions.</i></p><p><i>In the transition to a just and sustainable society, health care sectors will need to adapt to continue to function within a new socio-ecological system that is defined by less financial space for the continued growth of healthcare, limited availability of material resources and energy for medical treatments and infrastructure, and reduced societal complexity, translated into reduced complexity within healthcare systems. Our current health care systems are heavily shaped by the growth-oriented economic systems they are situated in and demonstrate signs of ‘uneconomic growth’: growing evidence on overconsumption in healthcare (a combination of overtreatment, overdiagnosis, low-value care and pharmaceuticalisation), a considerable scale of avoidable iatrogenic harm, and the growing environmental impacts of the healthcare system. In different ways, health care sectors are already reaching their limits: rapidly increasing health expenditures, staff shortages, and ecological limits such as scarcity of resources or the need to limit emissions. These trends call for a debate within the health care sector on how to deliver value-based care within a future post-growth society, limiting harm to human health and the environment.</i></p><p> </p><p><b><i>Panel discussion</i></b></p><p>Hans Eickhoff, Interdisciplinary Centre of Social Sciences (CICS.NOVA), Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities (NOVA FCSH), Lisbon, Portugal</p><p>Judith Bueno de Mesquita, Essex Law School, University of Essex, United Kingdom</p><p>Shivani Kaul, Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands</p><p><i> </i></p><p><i>Transformative reorganization of health care in a post-growth world will be characterized by high levels of uncertainty and complexity which must require – and are embedded in – approaches that extend beyond professional knowledge and applied science. Alternative concepts of need satisfaction that acknowledge the biophysical limits of the planet but still operate under the conditions of industrialized society will not necessarily address the question of individual autonomy in the face of a professional service industry. Here, degrowth might call for promoting the capacity for “vernacular subsistence and conviviality”, in opposition to the expansion of industrialized products and technologies. Hence, the access to equitable health care must go together with the emphasis on autonomy, citizen participation, and the right to heal (or even to forego medical treatment).</i></p><p><i>The collective imaginary of adequate health care in growth-oriented – capitalist – systems is almost exclusively shaped by the belief that ‘more –a longer life and more health care – is better’ which configures illness as an individual defeat that must be mastered with the assistance of scientific and technological progress, defying – or even denying – the inevitability of death. While a substantial part of health care expenditure on an individual patient occurs during the last year of life, and particularly during the last month of life, also the total health care spending directed to those in their last year of life amounts to significant costs. Additionally, aggressive treatment itself entails for the dying and their closest friends and relatives. Advance directives for end-of-life care and living wills are not yet widely used but might be able to reduce overtreatment or harmful and futile medical intervention in in the face of terminal illness. </i></p><p><i>The concept of health commons is useful for imagining transformative concept of health. However, it has concentrated more on healthcare commons and knowledge commons connected to health than on health itself. Health is typically thought of as a personal good, but when social determinants of health are considered, personal health can be seen as commons. The political, economic, social, and cultural environment has an impact on individual health: Labor standards and workplace protection, natural environment, housing, diet, and health behavior. Thus, belonging to a community, living in a certain territory or country represents shared environments which impact human health.</i></p><p><i>While physical health is deeply related to socio-economic, environmental, and cultural determinants, mental health is no exception. Social determinants of mental health play a fundamental role in the genesis of psychiatric disorders, in the neurotic sphere, and on human well-being. Different mechanisms and perspectives, such social causation and selection, explain the detected social health gradient.</i></p><p> </p><p><b><i>Questions and answers</i></b></p>
