    CSS150. How to co-create knowledge for inclusive biodiversity policies?
  summary: >-
    <p>The EU-funded BioAgora project is developing the European Science Service for Biodiversity (SSBD) to act as a bridge between biodiversity knowledge and policy and create a participatory process for inclusive decision-making. Some key functions of the SSBD have already been identified, however, the capacity of the Science Service to involve a diversity of stakeholders still needs to be assessed and potential participatory processes identified. The Science Service is using several themes to test different functions instrumental for a transformative and inclusive science-policy-society interface. One of these is urban nature-based solutions, which this workshop contextualizes. Nature-based solutions are key actions for developing Urban Nature Plans and planting three billion trees, two main ambitions of the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030. Specifically, the BioAgora project aims to streamline knowledge of urban nature-based solutions from different scientific and non-scientific sources to ultimately fill existing knowledge and capacity gaps and support local spatial planning processes. The nature-based solutions approach unfolds transformative change in many different ways. Its multifunctional and multidisciplinary character fosters a plural-value perspective in decision-making processes to account for nature's instrumental, intrinsic, and relational values. In this sense, it articulates and navigates the importance of nature from a more holistic perspective beyond the narrow goal of economic growth.</p>

Susana Orta-Ortiz , University of Trento  <br>  <br> Karmen Czett , Environmental Social Science Research Group (ESSRG)  <br>  <br> Kata Fodor , Environmental Social Science Research Group (ESSRG)  <br> Description :  A critical challenge of overcoming biodiversity loss and unsustainable economic growth lies in ensuring that the voices and perspectives of diverse social groups are integrated into the policy-making process. Science-policy interfaces could act as a bridge between scientific research and policymaking, fostering the inclusion of ecological principles in policy design. The EU-funded project BioAgora is developing a new Science-Policy Interface, the European Science Service for Biodiversity (SSBD). One of the goals of the Science Service is to create a multi-level, deliberative, participatory process to incorporate societal value choices and knowledge into biodiversity decision-making. Inclusive knowledge production can play a pivotal role in a degrowth-oriented future by ensuring that diverse perspectives are integrated into decision-making processes, fostering more inclusive and just policies. The EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 highlights that significant changes in biodiversity conservation and restoration cannot be achieved without changing the current policy context, and therefore calls for transformative governance among its main objectives. The Strategy also underlines that accessing robust knowledge and information is a key aspect of transformative governance. Broadening the knowledge base of biodiversity-related decisions and ensuring access to it for a variety of stakeholders can improve the outcomes and support the effective implementation of the Biodiversity Strategy. This is also required for the inclusion of relational and intrinsic values of nature (Kelemen et al., 2023), moving beyond a purely materialistic understanding.   Consequently, a call for establishing the European Science Service for Biodiversity was launched by the European Commission to create an inclusive platform to ratchet up the Biodiversity Strategy. The Science Service acts as a bridge between scientific research and policymaking, fostering the inclusion of ecological principles in policy design. In order to produce credible (i.e. valid, reliable), relevant, (timely, useful) and legitimate (value plural) outcomes, which are considered criteria of success for functional science-policy interfaces (Heink et al., 2015), the forthcoming Science Service should engage with a diversity of existing actors, creating new avenues of knowledge exchange and opportunities for participation of non-traditional knowledge holders.  BioAgora invites participants to take stock of the preliminary analysis of the European science-policy sphere on biodiversity and to think together about the governing principles and guiding values of an inclusive future Science Service. Research in the first two years of the project revealed capacity gaps and other, systemic challenges that impede the implementation of the Biodiversity Strategy, and assessed the expectations towards the Science Service from across various stakeholder groups (e.g. EU-level policy and administration, boundary organizations operating at various scales, scientific actors, businesses, and NGOs). Based on these results, and lessons derived from BioAgora demonstration cases, some key functions of the future Science Service have already been identified. However, the capacity of the Science Service to involve a diversity of stakeholders still needs to be assessed and potential participatory processes identified.   This workshop will give a brief overview of the Science Service developed in BioAgora and the different functions it will serve in the future. After this introductory part, workshop participants will be invited to an interactive exercise to assess and co-design the governing principles of the Science Service, which can ensure broad participation of diverse stakeholders. To make it more practical and avoid staying on a purely theoretical level, the process will be illustrated through the BioAgora demonstration case on urban nature-based solutions (NbS). Specifically, the workshop’s activities will be contextualized around a particular policy problem related to urban NbS, e.g., indicators for monitoring the development and implementation of urban greening plans in cities. The workshop will simulate real-life interactions between different stakeholder groups in the Science Service, including urban planners and practitioners, local authorities, private landowners, vulnerable populations and urban green space beneficiaries, local NGOs, small businesses, and research institutions. These discussions will be facilitated by researchers from BioAgora who will coordinate the interactions among the actor groups.  After this roleplay, workshop participants will reflect on their experiences as representatives of critical stakeholder groups and engage in a joint discussion about the processes, values, and governing principles needed for an effective and inclusive Science Service. They will be encouraged to identify barriers to inclusivity and brainstorm about potential ways to overcome these, fostering the inclusion of societal actors across different cultural and geographical contexts. Emerging ideas will be discussed among participants and noted down by BioAgora researchers to share with the BioAgora consortium as crucial inputs for an upcoming, publicly available deliverable of the project. This workshop aims to help revise and refine the governing principles of the future Science Service to create an inclusive SPI that not only provides access to biodiversity knowledge, but also empowers the collective agency of a diverse set of stakeholders, enabling transdisciplinary knowledge co-production. Questions to be considered during the workshop:  <br> Whose participation is relevant for biodiversity policy?   <br> What are the main barriers of inclusive policymaking?   <br> What values, governing principles, and processes are needed for an inclusive Science Service?   <br> How to design an SPI in a way that does not reflect the interests of current economic and political elites? </p>  <p>Literature: Heink, U., Marquard, E., Heubach, K., Jax, K., Kugel, C., Neßhöver, C., Neumann, R.K., Paulsch, A., Tilch, S., Timaeus, J. and Vandewalle, M., 2015.
