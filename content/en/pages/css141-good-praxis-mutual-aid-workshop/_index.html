    CSS141. Good Praxis mutual aid workshop
  summary: >-
    <p>Good Praxis is art education for climate justice, celebrating successful models of resistance and survival. As not everyone can participate in blockades or strikes, mutual aid gives people agency to organise themselves to meet the needs that are not being met by people in power. Based on solidarity, not charity, this support is called mutual aid. In this workshop, artists Lars Holdhus, Juha van 't Zelfde and Arnau Sala Saez will introduce the concept of mutual aid with examples from around the world. Following the introduction, we will do a mutual aid workshop to outline the group's wants, haves and needs and draw up possible new mutual aid projects (across borders and local). Mobilising on a grassroots level can be essential to introduce degrowth principles locally and across borders. Through this workshop, you can learn how art can drive change, create new initiatives and strengthen local communities.  This workshop is open to artists, activists and researchers.</p>

The workshop focuses on how art, climate justice and mutual aid can be combined to create a more integrated and different art practice that follows degrowth principles.  By focusing on the participant's past experiences, individual desires and future, it’s possible to create new organisations and ideas, including all participants. This workshop has already been arranged in several around Europe and carries the experience of previous workshops with its organisers. By prioritising social and ecological well-being through degrowth, it's essential to mobilise on a grassroots level. Artists, researchers and activists can play an active role in this. Through this workshop, you can learn how art can drive change towards more degrowth-aligned policies, more local initiatives and building local communities and communities across borders. Care, solidarity, and autonomy are often more accessible through setting up parallel power structures and mutual aid rather than a state-based solution. This workshop is open to artists, activists and researchers.  About the organisers: Juha van 't Zelfde is a Finnish-Dutch artist, organiser and educator living in Amsterdam. In his work, he explores the revolutionary potential of collective creativity. Arnau Sala Saez is a musician and visual artist from Barcelona, Spain. His interest in the consequences of systemic powers and their assimilation in the world of art and music has motivated a series of meetings where, through the platform he has managed since 2012, anomia.info, different people are invited (musicians, philosophers, therapists, etc.) to contribute diverse sorts of tools to manage these consequences. Lars Holdhus is an artist and musician from Norway.  He has organised several workshops around decentralised self-hosted technology and different art-related topics. With a focus on social ecology and social technology, he is currently working on exhibitions and workshops around eco-masculinity and degrowth. The dynamic of the workshop: Organising a mutual aid workshop focusing on wants, haves, and needs can empower participants, strengthen community bonds, and lead to more effective resource allocation and problem-solving, ultimately contributing to the well-being and resilience of our communities. The mutual workshop can help build organisations locally or internationally, depending on the participants.  Outline of the workshop: Introduction and Video - 20 min The video will show various successful examples of mutual aid and an introduction to the theoretical and social history of the term, from Peter Kropotkin to Dean Spade.  Wants: 10 - 20 min Participants describe what they want and dream about concerning art, climate crisis, organisation and degrowth. Haves: 10 - 20 min Participants describe what they have of resources and how they can contribute to realising the “wants” part. Needs: 10 - 20 min Participants describe what is needed for a project(s) based on Wants and Have's. Presentation: 5 - 10 min Participants collaborate on presenting what they have come up with to each other.  Participants can take breaks when needed.  Optimum <br>duration: 90 min Maximum <br>number of participants: 25 Minimum <br>amount of participants: 3</p>
