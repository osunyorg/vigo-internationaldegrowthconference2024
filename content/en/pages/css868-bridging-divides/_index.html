    CSS868 - Bridging Divides: A Transformative Workshop on Nonviolent Communication and Degrowth
  summary: >-
    <p>The "Bridging Divides" workshop offers an interactive and possibly transformative experience by combining nonviolent communication (NVC) with discussions on degrowth. Its primary goal is to foster dialogue between proponents of growth-oriented ideologies and advocates of degrowth, aiming to cultivate mutual understanding and explore pathways for societal transformation. In a world increasingly marked by societal divisions and fragmentation, this workshop addresses the urgent need for improved communication. Grounded in NVC principles, it equips participants with practical tools to engage in empathetic dialogue with humans who have radically different views. Through small group exercises, role-plays and facilitated discussions, participants will practice NVC techniques to understand diverse perspectives, motivations, and needs. By emphasizing active listening, empathy and recognizing shared needs, the workshop aims to transcend the growth-degrowth dichotomy and promote cooperation and collective problem-solving..</p>

Enabling radical change and institutional transformation; 13. Putting wellbeing at the center of the economy  <br>  <br> Organizers : Krämer, Marion (University of Applied Science Rhine-Waal, Germany ); van Oosten, Laura (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain); Žďárský, Tadeáš (NaZemi, Czech Repubic) </p>  <p>   <br>Expected audience:  No restrictions. Basic knowledge of NVC is welcome but not needed The "Bridging Divides" workshop is an interactive and possibly transforming experience that uses the principles of nonviolent communication (NVC) with the discourse on degrowth. Designed to facilitate dialogue between proponents of growth-oriented ideologies and advocates of degrowth, this workshop aims to foster mutual understanding, and thereby explore avenues for transformative societal change.  In today's world, we are seeing more and more societal divisions and fragmentation. Social cohesion is shattered. This is not least manifested in strong rightward shift in many societies but for example also in polarizing public debate about the legitimacy of radical climate activism. Fragmentation we also see between proponents of growth-oriented ideologies and advocates of degrowth.  The "Bridging Divides" workshop is a dynamic and interactive and possibly transformative experience designed to address the urgent need for improved communication in society. Grounded in the principles of nonviolent communication (NVC), this workshop aims to equip participants with practical tools and strategies to engage in empathetic dialogue with those having radically different views, enhance mutual understanding, and contribute to societal transformation. NVC has been effective in enabling dialogue and empathy between ideologically opposed groups in the past. By using NVC techniques, participants have been able to communicate their feelings and needs without triggering defensiveness or hostility, leading to increased understanding and empathy between the two sides.  This 90 minutes workshop aims at engaging in an NVC-dialogue between proponents of growth-oriented ideologies and advocates of degrowth. We will introduce the concept of NVC to the participants. We will practice NVC and empathetic listening in small groups. We will explore diverse perspectives and work out motivations, values, needs and concerns of individuals who identify with a growth and those who identify with a degrowth perspective. The workshop will emphasize the importance of active listening, recognizing underlying needs, and expressing concerns without perpetuating adversarial dynamics. Since we anticipate that mostly degrowth advocates will participate in the workshop, we will use role plays to bring in the degrowth opponents' perspective. Through facilitated group discussions and collaborative activities, participants will try to identify shared values, needs and goals that transcend the growth-degrowth dichotomy. Emphasis will be placed on the potential for cooperation and collective problem-solving, fostering a sense of unity Tentative outline:  <br> Welcome and introduction  <br>  <br> What is NVC?    <br>  <br> Exploring different perspectives  Learn about the arguments, feelings, needs and concerns of individuals who identify with growth-oriented ideologies and those who advocate for degrowth  <br>  <br>  <br> NVC for regrowth Role-plays to practising NVC in scenarios related to growth and degrowth debates  <br>  <br> Finding common ground Reflective discussion on empathy and shared needs that transcend the growth-degrowth dichotomy  <br>  <br> Debriefing  <br> </p>
