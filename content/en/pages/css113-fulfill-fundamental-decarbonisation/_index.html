    CSS113. FULFILL: Fundamental Decarbonisation through sufficiency by lifestyle changes
  summary: >-
    <p>The interactive session will explore the transformative power of sufficiency in providing the infrastructures and policies that shape our societies in a way that reduces resource consumption and ensures well-being for all. Introduced by a keynote speech from Seán Fearon, a Research Fellow at CUSP, we dive into the FULFILL project's results, revealing insights from the micro- (individuals and households), meso- (local initiatives) and  macro level (national and EU policies enabling sufficiency habits). By combining expert presentations, interactive World Café discussions, and participatory policy voting, this session provides a comprehensive understanding of sufficiency while actively engaging participants in exploring its applications and potential policy implications.</p>

Seán's expertise lies in dissecting the intricate web of relationships between consumption, time utilization, well-being, and environmental pressures. In his speech, he introduces participants to the core concept of sufficiency, emphasizing its pivotal role in modeling sustainable lifestyles up to the year 2050. Introduction to World Café on FULFILL Results (15 minutes):  Following the keynote speech, the session delves into the core of its content: the presentation of results from the FULFILL research project. FULFILL is a Horizon 2020 research project funded by the European Commission that employs a mixed-method approach. The research is structured across three key levels: micro, meso, and macro, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of sufficiency's implications. Accordingly, the three brief 5-minute presentations will be structured in these three sections allowing participants to be well prepared for the consequent world-café discussions: Micro Level:  Offering insights into how individuals and households can integrate sufficiency principles to reduce their environmental footprint while enhancing overall well-being. Meso Level:  Examining how civil society organizations and local communities work towards more sufficiency on the local level and discussing the role of municipalities and multilevel governance in supporting local sufficiency initiatives working towards grassroots change. Macro Level:  Analyzing how national and EU policies can be reshaped to support sufficiency principles, with a particular focus on their impact on climate, economy, and society through the lens of macroeconomic models. Interactive World Café (30 minutes):  In this pivotal segment of the session, participants are encouraged to engage interactively and express their views and ideas. A "World Café" format is envisioned, where participants can choose between three groups, each focusing on one of the micro, meso, or macro levels discussed in the FULFILL research. This format facilitates dynamic discussions, brainstorming, and the sharing of insights. The discussions in the world café will be facilitated by 3 experts from the project that are experienced in the three different levels of FULFILL. These experts are the ones who kick off the world café with a short presentation on the findings of the respective level. Following the short presentations, participants can freely roam the room and decide which table they want to join (they can also split their time and change tables).  At the table, participants can ask questions, comment and discuss the presentation and FULFILL findings in general directly with the presenter. To guide the table discussions, each group of the world café will have one big poster board, on which they will find some of the main research outcomes as well as specific policy recommendations for the different levels that resulted from the project’s work. The facilitator will first show the different policy recommendations and then open a discussion with questions such as “which policy recommendations would you prefer to see implemented/resonates more with you and why?”. “Do any of the results surprise you? Why?” Participants will be able to discuss, write their ideas on sticky notes to be placed on the poster board, and rank the different policy recommendations based on their preferences using voting points.  Participants are free to move between tables, enabling them to delve deeper into any or all of the three research outcomes presented during the FULFILL results session. The flexibility of this format ensures that all participants can explore topics of personal interest, contribute their ideas for implementing sufficiency and gain a comprehensive understanding of sufficiency's potential. At the end of the world café, each facilitator will make sure everything is cleanly summarised in order to bring it back to the forum where they will present the results of the discussions to the entire group of participants.  Closing Plenum- Vote on Policy Recommendations (30 minutes):  The session concludes with a closing plenum. First, facilitators from each of the three World Café tables will present the main consensus and ideas discussed in each of the three groups in order to begin the final discussion and introduce the vote.   Then, participants will have the opportunity to collectively vote on policy recommendations that have emerged from the FULFILL research and the FULFILL citizen science workshops for each of the mirco, meso, and macro levels (which they have already discussed in the world café groups). They will also have the opportunity to see how their votes compared to those from the previous workshops in the project. This segment underlines the participatory nature of the FULFILL project, demonstrating how citizens have been directly involved in the formulation of policy recommendations that foster sufficiency in the EU.   The results from the session will also be shared on the FULFILL website and social media afterwards, allowing participants to share with their networks.  Additionally, the facilitators will provide final thoughts, summarizing the key insights and policy recommendations generated during the interactive discussions. This provides a synthesis of the session's outcomes and helps participants leave with a clear sense of the way forward. Duration and Participants: The optimum duration for this session is approximately 90 minutes, allowing ample time for in-depth discussions while ensuring that participants remain engaged throughout. The session can accommodate a maximum of 30 participants and a minimum of 8 participants. This range ensures diversity of perspectives and effective group interactions without overwhelming the audience. Audience Participation:  The session is designed to foster active audience participation through the following interactive modalities: World Café Discussions:  Participants actively engage in discussions, brainstorming, and sharing their insights, experiences, and ideas related to sufficiency at micro, meso, and macro levels. Policy Voting:  The audience actively participates in deciding which policy recommendations resulting from the FULFILL project are most relevant and valuable, thus validating FULFILL research and contributing to decisions on which policies may be most important to share with policymakers.  In summary, the "FULFILL: Fundamental Decarbonisation through sufficiency by lifestyle changes" session not only provides a comprehensive understanding of sufficiency but also actively engages participants in exploring its applications and potential policy implications. By combining expert presentations, interactive World Café discussions, and participatory policy voting, this session contributes significantly to the larger degrowth debate by promoting sustainable lifestyles, community involvement, and a democratic approach to shaping the future of our planet. It serves as a catalyst for collective action and sustainable prosperity.</p>
