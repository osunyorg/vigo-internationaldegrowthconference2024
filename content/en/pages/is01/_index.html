        <p>This is a proposal for a collective on-site reflection.</p><p>Despite being a prominent part of the current anthropogenic predicament, tourism can be regarded in a more comprehensive light.</p><p>Being a social and personal experience, tourism has been called "the business of happiness" (that should bring well-being for all stakeholders, not just perpetuate profit and privilege) (Chías, 2004) and creates a bubble of a special time-space (Donaire, 2008) in which responsibilities are somehow suspended. This is not a new idea. The supposedly dichotomical division between the Latin terms otium/negotium is but an illusion: one feeds the other, and both were valuable parts of a citizen's life (Boullosa, 2012).</p><p>During the second Industrial Revolution, leisure time was the only opportunity for the working classes to be in nature and to educate themselves in ahteneums and museums. Social reformists such as Ruskin were tireless travellers who set up museum collections and gave lectures for the education of the less privileged (Hanley and Walton, 2010). He was also one of the intellectual inspirations for the foundation of the British National Trust.</p><p>More recently, Parellada's (2009) definition of tourism acknowledges human connection as the main characteristic of this phenomenon. He also stresses that even in privileged societies some individuals may cut on the budget for basic needs to be able to engage in activities that allow them to accumulate social capital (such as tourism). This idea bridges over the idea of tourism as a setting for self-examination and personal growth (Crous-Costa, ongoing).</p><p>Drawing on these premises, this intervention would like to invite participants to engage in a brainstorming discussion on topics such as:</p><ul> <li>The need for rest and the discomfort in resting<br> </li> <li>Your ability to pause, look at the other and self-reflect<br> </li> <li>Your relation to nature: taking and giving<br> </li> <li>When and how do you relate to your heritage (town fairs, museums, traditions around the year, consumption of "high culture"...)<br> </li> <li>Cultural extractivism vs. homecoming<br> </li> </ul><p>The final aim of this intervention is to start a reflection on the values, challenges and practices that we set in motion in a time in which (at least some of) the capitalistic restraints to life are suspended. By starting to acknowledge them, it is possible to reflect on their value (if any) in the shaping of narratives, aesthetics and behaviours for an upcoming social paradigm.</p>

        <p>We plan on integrating the Wilberian Four Quadrants model of "Me" (the individual, upper left quadrant) to "We" (the interior collective, lower left quadrant) through an exploration of ritual design. The session would inform our research on "How might ritual be a practice to embody degrowth?". We are building on the work of thinkers such as Frantz Fanon, Donna Haraway, Theodore Roszak and Sally Weintrobe. This experience intends to integrate several frameworks and schools of thought, such as the Inner Development Goals of being, thinking, relating, collaborating and acting and incorporating thinkers from the Deep Ecology movement, such as Arne Naess, Joanna Macy and Stephan Harding. We reference the work of Simone de Beauvoir, Raya Jones, Carl Jung, Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Viktor Frankl and Irvin D. Yalom from existential and Jungian psychology.</p>
