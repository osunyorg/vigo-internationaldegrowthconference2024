    <p>  <br> When: Friday 14 June, at 7.00 p.m.  <br>  <br> Where: Ramal Port, Vilagarcía de Arousa  <br>  <br> Organiser:  Post-Growth Innovation Lab  &  Greenpeace  <br> We will visit the iconic Greenpeace icebreaker  Arctic Sunrise , which will dock for a few days in Vilagarcía de Arousa ( Peirao do Ramal ). The Arctic Sunrise arrives in this town as part of the organisation's expedition to demand the ratification of the Global Oceans Treaty and the creation of marine protected areas. Greenpeace will offer us a guided tour where crew and activists will tell us about the struggles experienced by this ship in favour of a healthy and peaceful planet.  If you want to come by public transport with us, we will leave Pontevedra Station on the 6:32 p.m. train towards Vilagarcía de Arousa and from there we will walk to Peirao do Ramal. We have no specific time for the return, so take the most convenient return ticket for you. The estimated duration of the visit to the boat is 30 minutes but there will be other activities at the dock. Remember to buy your train tickets well in advance. If you go on your own, we will meet at 7:00 p. m. in front of the boat There are no more places available!</p>
