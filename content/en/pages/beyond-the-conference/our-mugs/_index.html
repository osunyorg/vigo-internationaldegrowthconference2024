        <p>The pottery of Buño (Olería de Buño) is one of the traditional centers of ceramics in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. In general, Buño pottery is of very good quality and highly valued compared to that of other centers of production.</p><p>In Buño (Malpica - Galicia) pottery activity has been documented since the sixteenth century. The potter's trade is recorded as a traditional occupation from 1510.</p><p>Along its history, most of the inhabitants of Buño have been related to the clay industry. At the end of the 20th century, the elders of the town told that there were more than eighty active potteries, with two wheel lathes in each pottery, one for the owner and another one for an official worker.</p><p>The oleiros of Buño made utensils for daily use (pots, plates or jugs, among others). With the arrival of materials such as plastic, the pottery industry went into decline, causing most of the artisans to look for alternative employment. </p><p>At the end of the 20th century, the recovery of this sector began, turning it into a cultural and economic claim within Galicia. The industry was modernized and specialized as a craft that would find a market in tourism and souvenirs. </p><p>This updating and reconversion to manufacture decorative and artistic elements did not leave aside the manufacture of traditional pieces, and contributed to mix the knowledge of several generations while innovation came to stay.</p>
