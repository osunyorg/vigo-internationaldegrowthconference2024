summary: >-
  <p>After a week of academic activities, we invite participants of the Degrowth Conference to spend a day with the Brigadas Deseucaliptizadoras to help in their quest for a Galician monte without eucalyptus and other invasive species. The invasion of eucalyptus in large parts of Galicia cannot go unnoticed by anybody visiting this region of Spain, where eucalyptus accounts for 28% of Galician forests and imposes a serious threat to rural livelihoods and ecosystems.</p>

        <p>The <b><i>Brigadas Deseucaliptizadoras </i>is a grassroot movement working against the invasion of eucalyptus, acacia and other exotic species in the Galician <i>monte</i></b>. About once per month a <i>roga</i> (or work session) is organized by a local community (e.g. neighborhood community, Communidade de montes, NGO) together with the <i>Brigadas Deseucaliptizadoras</i>, calling on the many <i>brigadistas</i> living across Galicia to come and work in the <i>monte </i>together with local communities. After the <i>roga</i>, follows the <i>albaroque</i>, which loosely translates to ‘feast’, and the community of volunteers comes together to eat, drink, and enjoy activities like music, talks, or walks in the <i>monte</i>.</p><p>On Saturday June 22<sup>nd</sup>, <b>we invite participants of the Degrowth Conference to contribute to the removal of exotic invasive species in Galician common lands</b> and experience first-hand how local communities go about eradicating invasive species. Perhaps this could be the seed to an even larger movement! We will organize transport from Pontevedra and back, in addition to food, drinks, and afternoon activities. The program of the day is as follows:</p><ul> <li>9:30: depart from Pontevedra by bus</li> <li>10:15: arrival at Campo Maneiro (Taragoña, Rianxo), welcome</li> <li>10:30-14:00: work in the <i>monte</i> eradicating acacia</li> <li>14:00-16:00: food and drink provided by Montescola and <i>comunidade de montes </i><i>de O Fieitoso</i> </li> <li>16:00-18:00: visiting Monte Fieitoso: regenerative grazing with goats, bee hives and school farm project</li> <li>18:00-18:45: return to Pontevedra</li> </ul><p>It is important to <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPdyF9KgHOApNeIekyzM63q8IOGxIXR3CwCvxuggghfb02oA/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">fill in this sign-up sheet <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> </b>so that we can prepare adequate material, transport, and food.
