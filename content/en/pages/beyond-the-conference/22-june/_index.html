    Field trip - Session in the Monte with the Brigadas Deseucaliptizadoras
  summary: >-
    <p>After a week of academic activities, we invite participants of the Degrowth Conference to spend a day with the Brigadas Deseucaliptizadoras to help in their quest for a Galician monte without eucalyptus and other invasive species. The invasion of eucalyptus in large parts of Galicia cannot go unnoticed by anybody visiting this region of Spain, where eucalyptus accounts for 28% of Galician forests and imposes a serious threat to rural livelihoods and ecosystems.</p>
