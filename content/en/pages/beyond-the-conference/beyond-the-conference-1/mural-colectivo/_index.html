        <ul><li>  <b>Contributing ideas</b> for the co-design before the Conference through <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZIdQwXyX-6WHtozIYhAvmTrFub12U_qMj9Ns59DXuIQHF_g/viewform" target="_blank">this link</a>  </li></ul><ul><li>  <b>Painting</b>: participants will receive a paintbrush and paint to fill in the defined spaces. The chalk draws the collective design and marks the boundaries where to put the colour in a simple and clean way, no need to smudge;-)</li></ul><ul><li>  <b>Imagining</b>: within the mural area there will be a table with papers, paints, pencils, etc. where people who wish to do so can write down ideas, reflections, objectives, draw graphic elements inspired by the talks and reports of the Conference, all of this to continue with the design of the mural.<br><br>  </li></ul>
