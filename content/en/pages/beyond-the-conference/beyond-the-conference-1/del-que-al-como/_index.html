    Book presentation and debate - Decrecimiento: Del Qué al Cómo (Degrowth: from what to how)
  summary: >-

A more specific analysis will be made of the economies of the Basque Country and Catalonia. Finally, we will reflect on how to achieve these transformations from a trade union perspective.</p>

    <p>  <br>When:  Wednesday 19 June 2024, 18.15h  <br> Where:  Pazo Mugartegui . Paza da Pedreira, Pontevedra Who:  Adrián Almazán  (Universidad Carlos III, Madrid)  Chair:  Mario Pansera  (Post-Growth Innovation Lab, Universidade de Vigo) <br>The <br>activity will be carried out in  Spanish </p>  <p>   <br>Book synopsis: "Decrecimiento: del qué al cómo"  We are in <br>the midst of a multidimensional crisis that is taking our globalised, <br>industrialised civilisation by storm. From this ongoing fracture, no new social <br>order will inevitably emerge. Quite the contrary. The global eco-social crisis <br>has made our future, for better and for worse, more open than ever. It is in <br>this context that this book was born, proposing an economic and social <br>transformation in Spain from the perspective of Degrowth. Our aim has been to <br>move from the what to the how. To this end, we suggest roadmaps for <br>transforming sectors such as energy, materials management, food, industry, <br>construction, finance and tourism.</p>
