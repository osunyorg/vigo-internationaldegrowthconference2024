  The session will address how to implement de-growth measures in the main productive activities in Spain. A more specific analysis will be made of the economies of the Basque Country and Catalonia. Finally, we will reflect on how to achieve these transformations from a trade union perspective.

        <p><b>Book synopsis: "Decrecimiento: del qué al cómo" </b></p><p>We are in the midst of a multidimensional crisis that is taking our globalised, industrialised civilisation by storm. From this ongoing fracture, no new social order will inevitably emerge. Quite the contrary. The global eco-social crisis has made our future, for better and for worse, more open than ever. It is in this context that this book was born, proposing an economic and social transformation in Spain from the perspective of Degrowth. Our aim has been to move from the what to the how. To this end, we suggest roadmaps for transforming sectors such as energy, materials management, food, industry, construction, finance and tourism.</p>
