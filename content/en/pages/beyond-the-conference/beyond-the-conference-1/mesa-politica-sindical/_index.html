summary: >-
  <p>We live in a context of eco-social crisis in which resource depletion is a tangible reality. So the question we need to ask ourselves is how we will manage this degrowth and who will decide how much, how, where and, above all, who will degrowth. And in this respect, the role of political and trade union forces will be crucial. At this round table, we will try to learn about the proposals of the different political parties that have expressed, in one way or another, their recognition of the material reality of our planet, as well as the position and work of the different trade union organisations on degrowth. With a particular focus on the necessary social justice that must accompany this process and the inclusion of other formulas of participation that allow society to take part in this transition.</p>
