summary: >
  This round table, with the participation of feminist academics and activists with extensive backgrounds (Stefania, Barca, Amaia Pérez Orozco and Nina López), will address the question of how to think about an ecosocial transition from a feminist perspective, in which degrowth is a central movement. What elements are relevant to address this transition? How to approach it in order to counteract the direction towards green and digital capitalism that the ecosocial transition being engineered by supranational institutions such as the European Union is taking? These general and other more specific questions will be addressed through the contributions and discussion of the speakers and the contributions of the audience.
