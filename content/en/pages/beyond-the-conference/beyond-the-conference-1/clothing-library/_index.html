summary: >-
  This is an initiative based on Stella McShera's master's thesis. The idea is that people can bring an item of clothing to the conference to share and Stella will organise a "library" of clothes racks for everyone to borrow during the days of the event. This will allow attendees to bring less stuff when they travel but allow them to have enough clothes for the conference events. It is the sharing of clothes and the bringing together of the community through the experience of sharing.
