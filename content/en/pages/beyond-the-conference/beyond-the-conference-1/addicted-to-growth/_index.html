    Are you addicted to growth? What does it actually mean to be addicted to growth? And why is this important? The poster campaign "Addicted to Growth?" on the streets of Pontevedra sparks precisely these questions, preceding the annual conference on degrowth, which is hosted in Pontevedra this year. The campaign is inspired by the book "Addicted to Growth, Societal Therapy for a Sustainable Wellbeing Future" by Robert Costanza.We know what it means to be addicted to alcohol, or smoking: you are craving for a drink or a cigarette and you can't hold yourself back, even when you know it is not good for you. You're not in control anymore. But how does that work with (economic) growth? At the level of society? We refer to the aforementioned book by Costanza for details, here we ouline the idea.Most of us will agree that our current economic activty is eventually destroying our habitat, much like what happened to Easter Island. We contend that the economy as a whole is the sum of our individual behaviours. And if our society is addicted to growth then this is because each of us is addicted to growth. For this reason the campaign focusses on the question: what does it mean to be addicted to growth? On a personal level.The answer to this question is not that hard. We may not have phrased it as addictive behaviour yet, but we all know the answer. Addicted to growth means that you do things knowing, or at least suspecting, that you should not do this in view of it's impact on our planet, the future and us. So let us establish the way out:Once you have realised that you are addicted to growth and you want to quit your addiction, we also know how to do just that: envision your future life free of that addiction. So now we walk you through the questions on the posters hoping to inspire you to form your vision of your future free form your addiction to growth.<br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>My approach isa. taking careb. quid pro quoI want toa. negotiateb. find common groundWe should organise our economy usinga. marketsb. commonsI believe our planet isa. meagreb. abundantI want toa. shareb. tradeWe should change oura. behaviourb. economic systemWhat's in ita. for me?b. for us?I want toa. competeb. cooperateCommerce is abouta. grantingb. outsmartingc. winningI dream ofa. a better worldb. more moneyI want everythinga. for freeb. at a discountc. none of the aboveMoney is aa. goalb. meansI do what Ia. canb. feel likeI take what Ia. needb. wantPaya. backb. forwardI want to bea. richb. happyc. like Muskd. like GandhiI travel bya. trainb. planec. card. bikeI ama. ownerb. stewardc. none of the aboveI ama. your competitorb. your friendc. another youI am aa. carnivoreb. omnivorec. herbivored. vegetarianGrowth isa. a goalb. the goalc. not a goald. a meanse. a consequencef. not necessary (anymore)g. overrated
