summary: >-
  After the introductory talk and workshops of the previous day, Scientist Rebelion will organize a ''mock action'', in order to encourage attendees to be part of real actions and introduce them to this kind of situation. The attendees will have to organize the action based on what they learned the day before and the activists of Scientists Rebellion will serve as advisors on how to deal with the different situations that may arise from these peaceful resistance actions.
