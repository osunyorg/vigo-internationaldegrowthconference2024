    Closing Festival
  summary: >-
    <p>After an intense week of activity, we will close the ESEE-Degrowth 2024 International Conference with a fantastic event in which we will have live music, food and drink and a great "queimada", a characteristic Galician drink made by burning brandy and sugar until most of the alcohol is consumed, to which other ingredients can be added, such as coffee beans, pieces of fruit, etc. The preparation of this drink will be accompanied by the reading of its characteristic incantation to ward off evil spirits.</p>
