Along the 4000 kilometre journey they connected with fellow rebels and other climate activists from like-minded movements in Spain, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The journey was documented in a film and a book, in which activists and experts in different fields collaborated. </p>  <p> La cultura declara la emergencia  <br>La Cultura Declara la Emergencia , originating in the United Kingdom, aims to get institutions and individuals linked to the world of culture to take a stand against the climate and ecological crisis and the criminal inaction of governments by signing and publicly adhering to its declaration.  It is a growing international movement of people and organisations in the arts and culture who declared a climate and ecological emergency. Launched in 2019, its collective imagination now includes the creative voices of cultural professionals, artists, artisans, performers, educators, producers and venues across the UK and also with international hubs in India, Australia, USA, Germany and Spain. Their values are underpinned by Telling the Truth, Taking Action and Demanding Justice. They declare that life-support systems on Earth are in imminent danger, threatening both human civilisation and the biodiversity on which it depends. The cultural sector is one of the most active contributors to creating a regenerative future that protects the planet and sustains everyone, everywhere. </p>
