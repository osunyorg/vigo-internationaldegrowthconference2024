        <p><i>2020: The Walk</i> is a project by the artist, researcher and activist Marta Moreno Muñoz, a journey on foot between Granada and Helsinki - with some trains and a ferry, and from there to the permafrost - to spread the word about Extinction Rebellion, a global environmental movement whose stated aim is to use non-violent civil disobedience to compel governments to take action to avoid triggering tipping points in the climate system, biodiversity loss, and the risk of social and ecological collapse. </p><p>The artist Oscar Martín, who accompanied Marta Moreno Muñoz throughout the journey, converged in <i>2020: The Walk</i> as an act born out of the political desire to put the body in the face of the eco-social crisis we are living. Along the 4000 kilometre journey they connected with fellow rebels and other climate activists from like-minded movements in Spain, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. The journey was documented in a film and a book, in which activists and experts in different fields collaborated. <br></p>

        <p><i>La Cultura Declara la Emergencia</i>, originating in the United Kingdom, aims to get institutions and individuals linked to the world of culture to take a stand against the climate and ecological crisis and the criminal inaction of governments by signing and publicly adhering to its declaration. </p><p>It is a growing international movement of people and organisations in the arts and culture who declared a climate and ecological emergency. Launched in 2019, its collective imagination now includes the creative voices of cultural professionals, artists, artisans, performers, educators, producers and venues across the UK and also with international hubs in India, Australia, USA, Germany and Spain.<br></p><p>Their values are underpinned by Telling the Truth, Taking Action and Demanding Justice. They declare that life-support systems on Earth are in imminent danger, threatening both human civilisation and the biodiversity on which it depends. The cultural sector is one of the most active contributors to creating a regenerative future that protects the planet and sustains everyone, everywhere. <br></p>
