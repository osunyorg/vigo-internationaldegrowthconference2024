summary: >-
  This exhibition of artists' work explores the practices, states, and cultures of water bodies impacted by lithium extraction and sea level rise, respectively. Before Air There Was Water, produced by artist Penelope Cain, documents processes of lithium extraction in the Atacama Desert from the non-human perspectives of water, soil bacteria and flamingos. Land Radius|2 (HDV:60 min) produced by artist Dr. Laura Donkers in Aotearoa New Zealand is a collaborative audio/visual exchange on the subject of irreversible sea level rise which juxtaposes imagery of the rising tide with the knowledge, fears, frustrations, and teachings from the tüpuna (ancestors) as told by two Māori attestants. There will be an artists’ talk held during the "Maniquesto" Special Session, 9am Thursday, which explores the works and the importance of the arts to Degrowth, chaired by Sofia Greaves.
