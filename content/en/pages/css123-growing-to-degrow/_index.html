    CSS123. Growing’ to degrow: A storytelling session with women farmers in alternative food networks of Galicia
  summary: >-
    <p>The increasing corporate control on inputs, outputs and supply chain of agriculture presents a major challenge towards achieving just and sustainable agri-food systems worldwide. Led by the values of endless growth, monopoly, control, and ‘food from nowhere’ these dominant models of agriculture are a major contributor to environmental degradation and injustices to producers and consumers. Alternative Food Networks (AFN), as situated, relational and care-based ways of imagining and mobilizing agri-food systems, have emerged in response to the challenges posed by these dominant models. This interactive panel brings together 5 women to tell stories of their personal journeys, motivations, experiences and challenges of being a farmer in AFNs in Galicia, Spain. Story-telling in this session is aimed to unpack the entanglements of the personal and the political, an important aspect of feminist politics and theory, that has still been marginally explored in the de-growth literature and movements.</p>

Appadurai (1981) describes food as a ‘highly condensed social fact’ that ‘presupposes and reifies technological arrangements, relations of production and exchange, conditions of field and market, and realities of plenty and want’ (p.494). Dominant agri-food systems, represented by corporate control on inputs, outputs and supply chain of agricultural produce, present a major challenge towards achieving just and sustainable food systems worldwide. Led by the values of monopoly, control, ‘food from nowhere’ and profit maximization, these dominant systems are a major contributor to environmental degradation and injustices to producers and consumers. Scholars working with the framework of Food Regimes have discussed meta-historical views of the entanglements of agri-food systems and associated processes of production, distribution, and consumption with the global cycles of capital accumulation (McMichael 2016, Friedmann 2005).  Alternative Food Networks (AFN), as different ways of imagining and mobilizing agri-food systems, have emerged in response to the challenges posed by the dominant capitalist models (Watts et al. 2018, Goodmann et al. 2012). Depending on the context different models of AFN get operationalized in local settings that embody values of harmony and relationality with nature, community and sharing, ‘food from here’, and just production and consumption. Some examples of AFN include farmers markets, food and seed festivals, community gardens and collectives, cooperatives etc. Different combinations of rural and urban inhabitants, producers, suppliers and consumers, and people of different age and gender often constitute the AFNs. Although, AFNs enjoy different degrees of popularity and success in their local settings, standing in opposition to dominant and powerful model of agri-food systems is not always an easy task. As a result, AFNs have to deal with internal and external struggles of different kinds on a regular basis. Academic literature has dealt more on the celebration of values and democratic ideals of AFNs and less on day-to-day challenges and tensions that the members of AFNs deal with. To better understand the challenges posed by growth and accumulation centric agri-food systems and potential of AFNs as counter-movements, an immersion into everyday mundane practices, challenges and motivation is essential. This closed, interactive panel aims to bring the experiences, motivation, struggles and stories of women farmers who are part of AFNs in Galicia, Spain. Situated in the north-western coast of Spain, Galicia is traditionally dominated by rural agricultural and fishing communities(Pereiro and Prado 2013). However, the devaluing of rurality and agriculture and favoring of urbanization and industry in the modernist paradigm has pushed majority of local folks to either abandon rural areas in search for industrial jobs in the cities or align their interests with corporate agriculture and fisheries (Pereiro and Prado 2013). The dominant source of revenue generation is Galicia is tourism (Dabezies, J. and Ballesteros-Arias 2013) including rural tourism – a state-corporate invention towards museumization of rural-agricultural life. This session views research as an active and reflective world-making activity rather than a passive interpretation of the state of ‘nature’. This enables us to look at practitioners’ accounts as reflective story-telling. Story-telling as a research method provides the narrator/researcher/practitioner the agency to ‘make sense’ of the diverse entanglements of different aspects (social, political, personal, cultural, historical, economic etc) of social relations from their limited, situated, and partial perspectives (Haraway 2013, Lekoko 2007). Consequently, story-telling in this session is aimed to unpack the entanglements of the personal and the political, an important aspect of feminist politics and theory, that has still been marginally explored in the de-growth literature and movements. The session will last for 90 minutes where 5 women farmers will tell stories of their personal journey of being a farmer in AFNs in Galicia. The total number of participants are 6 (5 practitioners and 1 moderator). The format of the session will be storytelling for 50 minutes (10 minutes for each participant), followed by question-answers with the chair (15 mins) and open Q&A with the audiences (25 mins). <br>References Appadurai, A.
