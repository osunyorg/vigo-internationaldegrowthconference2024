  <p>In a theme of opening consciences, we are keen, with our team, to present to you a play, which will stage, the discovery of priceless and unsuspected truth. Pushing them to question and redirect their steps towards a healthy and harmonious future. From this piece we hope to open hearts with a song to begin with, integrated into the piece. We plan to end with a group song with the troupe and members of the public, for maximum healing. After, there will be an open exchange of ideas, on free questions linked to the piece, and our simple human condition on this earth, the idea being not a debate but a free and constructive exchange between be here present. Finally, around a meditation, we will harmonize together in silence, letting idea, feeling and emotion find their place.</p>

        <p>For many centuries, resources are massively exploited which has catastrophic consequences. The race for more technology is only leading to more exploitation of finite matter, which at the end only makes more troubles. Nowadays, we cannot let the humanity think that technology will save the world when it is participating to its fall. </p><p>Scientists are trying to “save the world”, with “renewable energy”, more and more technology but they are not realizing that what they are doing is causing more troubles than not doing anything. The conscious of what is used, where it comes, how it was extracted is not present. Moreover, the different steps for the transformation of mineral are not seen, neither the human cost nor environmental cost.</p><p>Additionally, this paradigm about the need of more technology leads to the rejection of any other field of science or approaches which accentuate the fact that knowledge form eastern countries is the only truthful one. Therefore social, economic and cultural inequities are push further and ancestral knowledge are being lost. </p><p>The experience which is propose here is a need to share our consciousness all together. We propose a theatre piece, in which music, traditional song and dance will take place. To let the magic happens, some art piece, video and pictures will be projected during the scene. The piece will be followed by a discussion with the audience and finish with a heart meditation. The main theme which will be explored during the play is the extraction of resources and its consequences, the need of spiritual connection to the earth, the recognition of indigenous and ancestral knowledges and the awakening of people.</p><p>The piece is about the awakening of consciousness considering the resources we are using, which lead to the questions on how we treat humans, animals, and the planet around us without being conscious of what it cost. However, the hope is still permitted, and the magic can still happen if we open our heart. </p><p>The piece is about the journey of a scientist who wants to catch the sun or even create a sun which deliver light and energy for infinite. She will try to find the reasons why what she wants to achieve is not working and she will realize that the products are changing the results of her research. She will recognize that they have different properties depending on where they are coming from. With time this scientist will ask herself about the sense of what she is doing, and she will recognize that the way she is working is problematic, she will recognize that the chemical that she is using are creating disasters all over the world. She will end up with doing research on minerals and look for the way there are extracted and where they are coming from. During this time her conscious on how the research is conducted will be awaken, and she will start to question the environment in which she is working.</p><p>In parallel, in a land where this exploitation is occurring (south America/Africa/Asia) a woman who is a priest/Chaman will make some dreams about how bad the situation can go if we let the world going in this direction. She tells her dream to her daughter and then she does a meditation in which she will call for a soul to come and see what is happening in her land and how bad it is going. She will succeed to connect the scientist through a mineral which comes from her land.  </p><p>The scientist will travel in the land of the Priest/Chaman and her daughter will lead the scientist thought her culture.  With time she will let herself catch by the knowledge of ancestral tribes and will create a special connection with a rock. This rock will reveal her that it is possible to create infinite energy and light but only if everything is done in harmony with the rest of the planet. The rock will show the scientist how she can create the light and energy. Then the scientist will show that to her community and make them realize what needs to be done and that the conscious and love can change the world.</p><p>The number of presenters is between 5 and 10, the optimal duration is 90 minutes: 45 min for the theatre piece, 30 min for the discussion and 15 min for the meditation. </p>
