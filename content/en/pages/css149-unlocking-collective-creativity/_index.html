    CSS149. Unlocking collective creativity for a sustainable future
  summary: >-
    <p>We invite participants to join for a collaborative workshop that delves deep into the question of why broad-scale socio-ecological transformation is not happening on the collective level. We aim to show how decommodified spaces, which we see as central for creating and embodying degrowth, can be both imagined and created in practice. We’ll explore strategies to cultivate decommodified spaces e.g. via body-mind, coaching, and healing practices, and reflect on the overall importance of these spaces for the degrowth movement. This creative work session will tap into the collective knowledge in the room, fostering a relaxed yet focused atmosphere that encourages deep engagement and connection through guided prompts and peer-led discussion. The workshop encourages self-reflection on our role as academics or activists, and emphasizes the crucial need to find and live ways of being in a more convivial state of connection to nature – including our colleagues at the conference.</p>

Our session offers an interactive and collaborative learning experience. Guided prompts will orient discussion along the lines of the potential for, and creation of, decommodified spaces. The focus will be put first within academia, then on the creation of these spaces in society broadly in line with degrowth principles and ideas. One can think of it as a creative work session with colleagues and friends, where we will tap into the collective knowledge in the room to explore open questions and concerns, fostering a relaxed yet focused atmosphere that encourages deep engagement and connection. Workshop Overview: We aim to show how decommodified spaces, which we see as central for creating and embodying degrowth, can be both imagined and created in practice. The workshop encourages self-reflection, questioning how as academics or activists we might be inadvertently involved in perpetuating epistemic violence and nature-destructive ways of perceiving, thinking, and acting. It emphasizes the crucial need to find and live different ways of being in a more convivial state of connection to nature – including our human colleagues and peers at the conference. Our primary aim is to progressively tap into the collective knowledge present in the room, enabling participants to explore their own questions and topics. Through peer-led discussions, participants will gain diverse insights and perspectives in a comfortable and low-pressure environment. The workshop will foster a sense of shared vulnerability through an introductory round, by giving everybody a chance to share some of their passions and frustrations, they are currently experiencing in academia and/or activism. The workshop itself provides space for individual sensing-feeling and reflecting on given prompts, as well as small group discussions on ‘ideal’ academia, vulnerability and the possibilities emerging from decommodified spaces. This format encourages intimate conversations and allows participants to engage deeply with one another. The simple and fast communication set-up enables experimentation with shifting individual consciousness to a more holistic and connected state of the collective. We explore how commodification disconnects us from our experiences and harness the power of collective intelligence to delve into what it's like to tap into the intelligence that becomes available when we become collectively vulnerable. Participants often discover that this workshops process allows them to re-connect to their own experiences in new and surprising ways. A critique of "dominant ideologies" naturally emerges when communicating and firmly connecting to our subjective experience. A key takeaway from this workshop will be to foster vulnerable dialogue settings, a practical approach that truly reveals its efficacy through experience. Through imaginative discussions and a bit of embodied exploration, we will explore the creation of decommodified spaces - both internally and socially - and through this exploration, examine the role of societal power structures, industries, politics, and more in shaping our future, especially in regard to whether and how they impede or enable a social-ecological transformation. In other words, this is to immerse ourselves in a decommodified space of knowledge creation. The setup of the workshop invites us to demystifying and de-intellectualizing social change, and to experience it as a social and communicational group process. With this workshop we intend to address the obstacles to broad-scale implementation of a social-ecological transformation. We recognize that the conditioning of the subjective, and the struggle for inter-subjective experiences to reassert themselves and their imagination against the structures of societal domination and control are among the most pressing problems and impediments to social-ecological transformation. We are looking forward to a journey of collective exploration, deep connection, and creative problem-solving as we work together to unlock the collective creativity needed for a more sustainable future and a successful social-ecological transformation.</p>
