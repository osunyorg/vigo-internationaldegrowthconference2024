    CSS148. Beyond words: embodied, situated and transdisciplinary approaches in participatory research
  summary: >-
    <p>This interactive session aims to reflect on the use of visual languages —in a broader sense— in both collective art-science research and situated collaborative processes. We seek to bring together a diverse group of feminist researchers and practitioners to dialogue around the ways we all develop embodied research practices.— departing from the reflection on the ways (our) bodies and emotions are involved when we do research. This encounter will be developed in two sections. In the first one,organizers will share previous science and practice-based projects engaged with a diversity of socio-ecological issues and embodied research practices with a focus on the use of visual languages. In the second section, we will facilitate a collective mapping exercise around the issues portrayed in the projects and the role of diverse languages in arts-science research. For this discussion, one of the organizers, Carla Boserman, will draw the dialogue through graphical listening practice.   </p>

Embodied research comes into<br>play when we engage with arts-based practices as part of the research<br>processes, such as when using storytelling, performance or focusing on<br>practices enacted by particular individuals or groups.  The session will focus on the role of<br>embodied and situated research, with particular attention to the visual arts as<br>a research tool that can open the space to other languages and ways of knowing<br>and relating to others, including other-than-humans. It will do so by bringing<br>together a diverse group of feminist researchers and practitioners and<br>establishing a dialogue with other participants in the session. Our motivation<br>to propose this interactive session responds to an ongoing conversation and a collective<br>interest in understanding in which ways our arts-based approaches, experiences<br>and methodologies intersect and the ways this can nurture and broaden our own<br>processes.  It also responds to an<br>increasing interest in the ecological economics and degrowth communities to<br>engage with arts-based approaches and the possibilities that the arts bring to<br>mobilize spaces often difficult to access with traditional methodologies, such<br>as the emotions and feelings linked to environmental and social conflicts. It is well established that arts can provide a space for<br>imagination, experimentation, and rehearsing alternative worlds and<br>relationships. In this regard, arts can enable the emergence of other values<br>and relational practices  that can help<br>transform hegemonic imaginaries. Moreover, involving our bodies in the process<br>of knowledge production opens the floor to other beyond-words forms of<br>expressing and knowing, often marginalized in academic settings.  Attention to different languages of valuation<br>and subaltern voices and experiences is both at the root of ecological<br>economics and the transformations required towards degrowth. The dialogues and<br>outcomes from this session aim to contribute to the growing interest that both<br>epistemic communities have on methodologies that foster radical and critical<br>thinking.  The 90 min session will be structured in two parts. During the<br>first part, we will share audio-visual stories, drawings and other material<br>from a selection of arts-science and practice-based research projects carried<br>out by the organizers. Some of them are Shared<br>Dialogues and Echoes, absences, porosities and other forms of<br>(re)encounter through the water. These projects will be introduced<br>at the beginning of the event. During the second part of the session, we will display and share<br>materials from each project and give participants the opportunity to explore<br>them. These materials will be the starting point for the second part of the<br>session, which will take place in the format of a collective reflection and a<br>live mapping space drawing on visual material, questions and conclusions from<br>the session. This second  part of the<br>session will be structured around the following core questions: <br>What reflections and emotions do the<br>materials generate?<br>What<br>strategies can we articulate to strengthen and incentivize arts-science<br>collaborations? <br><br>How can these<br>approaches activate social transformation processes? <br>Throughout the session<br>Carla Boserman (co-organizer) will perform a graphic listening and reporting<br>that will be made available to all participants and conference organizers<br>afterwards.
