    CSS166. Metamorfosis: exploring queer ecology and degrowth
  summary: >-
    <p>Metamorfosis is a groundbreaking project based in Barcelona, bridging the realms of degrowth and queer ecology. This event invites participants to a transformative and safe space where the struggles for queer liberation and environmental protection converge. Metamorfosis addresses pressing issues such as eco-anxiety among the youth, the urgency for socio-ecological transformation, and the need for a paradigm shift in ecology by fostering inclusivity, open dialogue, art and activism. It offers a platform for critical knowledge exchange, exploration, and collective action to catalyse the shift away from destructive economic growth towards a more sustainable, joyful society. Embodying alternative knowledge transfer, this event aims to make these values expand in order to reach society's cognitive, affective and existential dimensions, thus bringing about a necessary and complex metamorphosis. Metamorfosis blurs the boundary between academia and activism, offering a unique space for change-makers to envision a more harmonious future collectively.</p>

Metamorfosis is a collective experimental space embodying the philosophy of queer ecology and degrowth in play, art, conversation and practice. Both the planet and queer individuals face oppression from the same harmful forces of heteropatriarchy. By fostering an alliance between these two movements, we aim to unite and empower our collective efforts in defeating toxic binaries, boundaries, and norms that oppress not only queer individuals but all living beings on this planet. Metamorfosis is a space of inclusivity, acceptance, and activism to delve into the intersections of queer and environmental issues. The project aims to offer a space to collectively contribute to the socio-ecological transition towards a good life for all. It is an attempt to go beyond and reshape the boundaries of established academic practice. It means to bring together queers, artists and creatives, local communities and other social movements to bring about a societal transition. The Setting of 2023 Edition Can Masdeu is a historical and widely known space for ecological regeneration, activism and grassroots education. It has cultivated the culture of care as a form of resistance in Barcelona for over 20 years through its residence and community garden in Collserola Park. Located at the border between the hyper-densely populated city of Barcelona and the Natural Park Collsera, it links the two contrasting landscapes. The queer degrowth event means fostering safe and inclusive spaces within ecological activism and reclaiming opportunities for physical learning and movement-building. The house offers the necessary infrastructure for workshops and activities, such as a community kitchen and social centre, a garden, a forest and a dome. Session Overview: Our interactive session, "Metamorfosis – Exploring Queer Ecology and Degrowth," is designed to be an immersive journey into the heart of our first festival. This 90-minute session will revisit the inaugural Metamorfosis event by presenting videos, screenings, and workshops. We want to reflect on the past and look ahead to the future to shape it collectively, gaining insights from the public. The main topics will revolve around Embodied Ecologies, Multispecies Justice, Artivism, Queer Kinships, Eco-Feminism, Solar Punk and Decolonial Queer Ecology. Session agenda:  <br> Welcome & Introduction (5 Minutes): We will present the team and the history of this project from an academic setting to an activist movement.  <br>  <br> Revisiting Metamorfosis (25 minutes): We will begin by revisiting the highlights of the first Metamorfosis festival. Through videos and screenings, we'll transport you back to the atmosphere, discussions, and art workshops that define the event.  <br>  <br> Vision for the Future (15 minutes): We'll collectively imagine the next edition of Metamorfosis as a network, not a final product. In this segment, we'll explore new ways to expand our reach, make the event more inclusive, and encourage diverse contributions.  <br>  <br> Cocreation and Collaboration (30 minutes): We'll open the floor to the public to propose ideas, initiatives, or projects that could enhance the inclusivity and broadness of Metamorfosis' values.  <br>  <br> Syntheses & Insights (15 minutes): We'll conclude the session by collecting the insights gained during the session and exploring the potential for the festival's evolution collectively.  <br>  <br> In line with the spirit of Metamorfosis, we envision this event as an ever-evolving network of ideas and initiatives. This event is not a final product but rather a dynamic, networking, living entity where everyone is welcome to contribute.</p>
