summary: >-
  The flourishing field of degrowth studies already formulated over 530 policy proposals (Fitzpatrick, Parrique and Cosme, 2022). However, their implementation requires legal analyses combining in-depth knowledge of the law with creativity. While the legal literature openly tackling degrowth is still limited, degrowth proposals and other post-growth approaches are beginning to gain attention from legal scholars and activists. Given the historical and continuing role of the law in facilitating an economic growth-led, unequal, unjust, and socio-ecologically destructive model, bringing it in line with the degrowth theory is necessary.<br>In this context, a research agenda taking stock of the advances of legal research on degrowth and blazing a trail for future research is urgently needed. This research agenda encompasses perspectives from many different branches of the law (human rights law, competition law, energy law, environmental law, etc.), from international, regional and national regimes in both Global North and Global South jurisdictions.

        <p>As interest for the degrowth agenda builds up among civil society, policymakers and within academia, the contribution of lawyers is still far too limited. Indeed, while there are already numerous policy proposals to place society on a degrowth path, many of these proposals are still insufficiently operationalised and adapted to law-makers’ needs. This can be seen as a great disadvantage for the whole degrowth research field, because specific and understandable operationalisation and adaptation of policy proposals are an important, or even necessary, step for their introduction into the law-making process and further implementation.</p><p>The role of law is critical in addressing the aforementioned shortcomings as it forms the set of rules that govern us and frames virtually all policies and actions of modern states. Therefore, taking into account that legal provisions aim to be precise, clear, and unambiguous, and that legal systems have systematic, hierarchical, and logical structures, legal perspectives can help us better operationalise and adapt degrowth proposals to make them technically easier to be introduced into the law.<br></p><p>Many degrowth proposals will find legal stumbling blocks on their way. For instance, proposing to ban private jets may be challenged in courts, including on constitutional grounds of individual freedom. At the same time, the law - at both the national and international level - is drawn on by activists to leverage protection of the environment and human rights, particularly socio-economic rights, including recently in the contexts of the ecological and climate crises.  Legal insights on the obstacles and opportunities of law are therefore critical to help moving degrowth from the books to real life.<br></p><p>We, organisers of this proposed special session, have started drafting a research agenda for Degrowth and Law with the idea to publish it as a journal article some time after the conference has taken place.  We have each undertaken individual research and networking opportunities, and our special session would draw on our research, as well as the experience and knowledge of other participants, as a basis for discussion:<br></p><ul> <li>Romain Mauger published in 2022 his first piece on Degrowth and Energy law: the book chapter ‘Reshaping EU Energy Law: Towards Degrowth’, in the book A Force of Energy, Essays in Energy Law in Honour of Professor Martha Roggenkamp, edited by Ruven Fleming, Kars de Graaf, Leigh Hancher, Edwin Woerdman (University of Groningen Press). In 2023, he published the article ‘Finding a needle in a haystack? Identifying degrowth-compatible provisions in EU energy law for a just transition to net-zero by 2050’, in the Journal of Energy &amp; Natural Resources Law.  He also presented his research on degrowth and the law at 5 academic events since 2020.<br> </li> <li>Judith Bueno de Mesquita has a forthcoming article ‘Re-interpreting human rights in the climate crisis: moving beyond economic growth and (un)sustainable development to a future with degrowth’ Netherlands Quarterly of Human Rights (2024). In April 2024, she and Birsha Ohdedar will host a British Academy Conference at Essex University on “realising human rights in post-growth societies.” In 2023, Birsha and Judith organised a workshop ‘Degrowth and Law’ at SOAS, University of London, in April 2023.</li> <li>Marios Iacovides is currently conducting a long term research project on degrowth and EU law, with the example of competition law and policy, funded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters. His ambition is to see how a degrowth policy agenda could be implemented through EU internal market law, using competition law and state aid as examples of “horizontal” EU policies that could be affected by such an agenda but also instrumentalised to achieve it. His project will result in a monograph and a workshop, in Stockholm, on EU commercial law and degrowth.  </li> <li>Andrzej Strzałkowski is submitting his article “Adaptation and operationalisation of sustainable degrowth for policy: Why we need to translate research papers into legislative drafts?” and working on further articles related to his original research idea: the Translational Legal Approach. He also works as chief specialist in the Polish Ministry of Economic Development and Technology on renewable energy legislation, especially related to renewable self-consumers and energy communities.</li> </ul><p>We consider that interactively debating a research agenda for Degrowth and the Law at the 2024 Degrowth conference would be of great value both for the conference participants that could contribute to the debate and flag elements to be added to the reflection, and for the article’s writing team in order to enrich it.<br></p><p>There are more than 4 authors involved in this process, although only 4 names had to be provided for practical reasons and as requested by the organisers. For instance, Birsha Ohdedar (SOAS, UK) is not listed but he is also part of the authors’ and internal organising team. In total, the writing team for the research agenda will count authors from Global North and Global South countries and will cover the legal discipline from a diversity of specialised angles and with a focus on international, regional and national jurisdictions. Yet, to keep the special session manageable, there will only be between 1 and 3 presenters introducing the research agenda.<br></p><p>This will be a 90-minute closed special session, where 20 min will be dedicated to presenting the draft research agenda. Then, the audience would have 10 min for Q&amp;A and identifying topics they would like to discuss in the remainder of the session. Then, the audience would be divided in groups and have 30 min to reflect on how to improve the research agenda. A list of questions will be drawn to help spur the conversations. The last 30 min will be dedicated to discussing again in plenary, drawing from the discussions that the participants will have had in smaller groups.<br></p><p>The audience will consist of any conference participant interested in the topic of degrowth from a legal standpoint. We welcome academics of all ranks and disciplines, NGO members, civil servants, etc.<br></p>
