summary: >
  In alignment with the 10th International Degrowth Conference, this session serves as a transformative space, adapting Khandiz Joni's interactive art class &quot;The Beautiful Art of Letting Go.&quot; The session employs makeup as a medium for art, challenging societal norms and encouraging a dialogue around self-acceptance, vulnerability, and responsible consumption in an era of finite resources. 
  
  This session aims to offer a transformative and holistic experience that combines artistic practice with intellectual engagement, aligning closely with the conference's focus on degrowth through our relationship with consumption and ecological economics. It invites participants to explore not just the contours of their faces, but also the contours of their consumption patterns, their relationship with themselves, and by extension, the planet.
