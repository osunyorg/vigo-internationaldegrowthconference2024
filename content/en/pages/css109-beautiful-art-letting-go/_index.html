    CSS109. The beautiful art of letting go: A journey into Degrowth, Ecological Economics, and the Self
  summary: >-
    <p>In alignment with the 10th International Degrowth Conference, this session serves as a transformative space, adapting Khandiz Joni's interactive art class "The Beautiful Art of Letting Go." The session employs makeup as a medium for art, challenging societal norms and encouraging a dialogue around self-acceptance, vulnerability, and responsible consumption in an era of finite resources.  This session aims to offer a transformative and holistic experience that combines artistic practice with intellectual engagement, aligning closely with the conference's focus on degrowth through our relationship with consumption and ecological economics. It invites participants to explore not just the contours of their faces, but also the contours of their consumption patterns, their relationship with themselves, and by extension, the planet.</p>

    <p>  <br>  <br> Contributions format : artistic  <br>  <br> Keywords : Embodiment, Inclusivity, Consumption  <br>  <br> Related track(s) : 10. Challenging dominant values, ideologies, and imaginaries / 13. Putting wellbeing at the center of the economy  <br>  <br> Organizers : Towill, Khandiz Joni (Vujà Dé Creative Solutions, London, United Kingdom) </p>  <p> Full description  <br>   <br>Duration: A comprehensive 90-minute session. Participants: Open to 6-20 participants to ensure intimate and meaningful engagement. Technical Requirements: Participants are encouraged to bring their own colour cosmetics, skincare items like cleansers and moisturisers, and, if possible, their own makeup brushes. We will also provide clean paint brushes for the art activities. Session Flow:  <br> Introduction (15 min): A detailed orientation to the Human Givens framework, setting the stage for a dialogue around degrowth, ecological economics, and the themes of self and belonging.  <br>  <br> Active Listening Session (15 min): A guided discussion to help participants prepare mentally and emotionally for the upcoming art activity.  <br>  <br> Guided Art-Based Activity (10 min): Participants will engage in a guided exercise, using makeup to explore their faces and personalities, fostering a deeper relationship with themselves.  <br>  <br> Collaborative 'Masterpiece' (20 min): Participants will pair up to complete each other’s artwork, emphasising the principles of communal support and shared experiences.  <br>  <br> Capturing the Masterpiece: Photographs will be taken as a memento, serving as a lasting reminder of the lessons learned. Audience Participation: This session is highly interactive. Participants will not only engage in guided art-based activities but will also be integral to discussions, collaborative art-making, and post-session reflections. Contribution to Ecological Economics and/or Degrowth: Mindful Consumption: The session aims to challenge the consumerist narratives surrounding beauty, advocating for a more mindful approach to consumption grounded in the Human Givens framework. Holistic Sustainability: It brings to the fore the interconnectedness of personal well-being, societal norms, and ecological sustainability. Artistic Exploration: The session offers a unique artistic lens to investigate complex themes, such as personhood of nature, care, interdependence, and redefining our relationships. Link to Conference Themes and Values: The session embodies the core values of the conference: Equality, Inclusivity, Solidarity, and Sustainability. It encourages cooperation and civil society involvement by fostering a space for communal support and shared experiences. Moreover, the session will engage in discussions that challenge dominant ideologies, amplifying subaltern voices and promoting non-consumerist lifestyles.</p>
