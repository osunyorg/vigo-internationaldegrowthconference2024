summary: >-
  <p>Degrowth is a thriving field of interdisciplinary academic research uniquely coupled with a diverse activist movement, and the Degrowth Journal was established in 2022 to give this research a home: a home that allows researchers to expand degrowth imaginaries without a constant need to defend and explain degrowth, a home that facilitates healthy conceptual debate within the movement, and a home that embraces our values, breaking from the profit-led publishing paradigm. This interactive session will start by introducing the journal’s collective who will explain what motivated them to take the radical step of creating a new journal. The history, values and management of the journal will then be presented, including lessons learnt from publishing the journal’s first volume. Finally and most importantly, this session will provide a space for the degrowth community to discuss their experience with and expectations for the journal, and possibilities for degrowth-inspired academic publishing.</p>

        <p>The session, and the Q&amp;A and discussion elements in particular, will present an opportunity for the degrowth community - not just active researchers, but anyone interested in degrowth research or the values of slow science - to get to know the editors and the journal. The journal is a relatively new publication outlet and many degrowth researchers are still not aware of it, or are unfamiliar with its objectives, how to publish in it, or how to get involved in its operation, so this session is aimed at building awareness and accessibility of the journal.</p><p>Further, it will allow attendees to share their thoughts on the development of the journal so far, and what they would like to see from the journal - not only as the home of degrowth research, but also a pioneer in sustainable, anti-capitalist open access publishing - and it will likewise allow the editorial collective to explore ideas to develop and strengthen the journal. This will support the journal in advancing the quantity and quality of degrowth scholarship.</p><p>The session will be 90 minutes in length, divided as follows:</p><ul> <li>5 min: introduction of the editorial collective</li> <li>20 min: presentation on the development, management and next steps of the journal</li> <li>20 min: Q&amp;A with editors</li> <li>45 min: interactive discussion</li> </ul><p>Depending on the number of attendees the discussion element will either take place as one large group, or will split into small group discussions covering different aspects of the journal and academic publishing, before returning to the full group to provide feedback. </p>
