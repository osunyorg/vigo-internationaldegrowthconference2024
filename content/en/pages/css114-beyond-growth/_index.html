summary: >
  Bodh Gaya, being a UNESCO World-Heritage site since 2002 and the place of Buddha’s enlightenment, is known as a transnational tourist spot, given its extensive heritage, including the Mahabodhi temple complex and more than two hundred international Buddhist monasteries, which mostly developed after the 1950s. Heritage-based planning has remained a state-led activity in postcolonial India. The state used heritage planning as a tool to pursue unhindered economic growth and an exercise of nation-building. Dominant developmental actors focused on trickle-down economic theories based on unhindered growth to bring positive socio-economic transformations at the local heritage sites, which has largely failed to deliver inclusive growth. This session will re-imagine heritage-making in Bodh Gaya from a post-growth perspective. The papers in this session will examine the disconnect between the growth of Bodh Gaya and the well-being of the local populace and explore alternative perspectives for conserving the World Heritage site for future generations.

        <p>Bodh Gaya, being a UNESCO world Heritage site since 2002 and the place of Buddha’s enlightenment, is known as a transnational tourist spot because of its extensive heritage including the Mahabodhi temple complex as well as more than two hundred international Buddhist monasteries from various parts of the Buddhist world. A majority of these monasteries were established since 1950’s in the newly independent India since heritage-making in general and heritage-based planning, in particular, have remained a state-led activity in the postcolonial India. The state used heritage planning as a tool to pursue unhindered economic growth, which was an exercise of nation-building. The policy-makers, institutions, and dominant political actors focused on the trickle-down economic theories and their potential to bring positive socio-economic transformations at the local heritage sites.  This vision hasn’t really worked out at Bodh Gaya. In fact, there is a complete mismatch between the places and sites of affluence meant for national and global tourists and the world citizenry and spaces, which are predominantly inhabited by the local populace, especially low caste laborers and scheduled castes and tribes. There is a large under-belly in Bodh Gaya and in surrounding villages, which remains underprivileged, and vulnerable, and has failed to access the benefits of development brought by growth-orientated, tourism-centric models of heritage planning. This session will attempt to re-imagine heritage-making in Bodh Gaya from a post-growth perspective. Using multiple lenses, the papers in this session will examine the disconnect between the growth of Bodh Gaya and the well-being of the local populace.  Even though Bodhgaya attracts tourists from all over the world who come to seek spiritual well-being through meditation programs and social work opportunities, they adversely affect the local culture and environment. Proposed papers will identify pathways and processes based on the perspective emerging from Buddhist Economics through which more organic and just linkages can be established between the local populace, the heritage and the models of development, which can bring a just and fair future to the local population and conserve the world heritage-site for the future generation.  </p><p><b>Why Degrowth?<br></b></p><p>The session will contribute to the degrowth perspective on urban planning and heritage-making in the Asian context, a crucial yet under-explored area of research in the broader degrowth literature. Moreover, it will fuse heritage-making debate in the Buddhist Economics framework, which is emerging as a crucial framework for reimaging economics for the well-being of humans. After the prominent work of E. F. Schumacher, Small is Beautiful: A Study of Economics as if People Mattered, Buddhist Economics is again gaining traction through the work of Clair Brown, Professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley and director of its Center for Work, Technology, and Society and others. This session will employ ideas such as the interconnectedness and interdependence of humans with each other, with nature and with the sufferings of each other. We will re-imagine heritage-making exercises in Bodh Gaya from these holistic and mindful ways and offer visions of world-heritage sites from a post-growth perspective.<br></p><p><b>Presentations<br></b></p><p>This session will bring researchers from several top-ranked higher education institutions, advocacy and civil society groups from India, Spain, USA and Switzerland.<br></p><ul><li>Chair- Abhishek S.
