summary: >
  Degrowth started in France in the beginning of the 2000's when a group of adbuster activists met with academics and intellectuals radically criticising the imperialist concept of development and epistemologically rejecting utilitarianism in social sciences. Since then, Degrowth became a field of research, and it is more and more discussed in well established research societies. Nevertheless, the fundamental criticism of the current system is less apparent related to the knowledge creation process. Questions about how knowledge is created, who the participants are and who benefits from the research results often remain un-reflected.<br>The aim of this session is to highlight the need of more democratic, participatory approaches, and present possible ways to co-create knowledge in contributing to the transformation. Through a round table discussion with prominent researchers dealing with degrowth and epistemologically reflecting on Degrowth and academia, we would like to explore participatory research methodologies.

        <p>Degrowth started in France in the beginning of the 2000's when a group of adbuster activists met with academics and intellectuals radically criticising the imperialist concept of development and epistemologically rejecting utilitarianism in social sciences. In 2002, they published a special edition on S! lence: sustainable and convivial degrowth. This publication was very successful and a new movement emerged. It was first highly dominated by activism, politics and practice.</p><p>Later, degrowth started to receive more and more attention in research, especially since the first international academic degrowth conference organized in Paris in 2008. It marked the beginning of an international movement in which however, a shift could be observed between activism and academic research. Degrowth, as an activist movement often focused on local citizen initiatives, and its international reputation become known through scientific publications.<br></p><p>Degrowth became a field of research. It is more and more discussed in well established research societies, first in Ecological Economics. Within the research community of Ecological Economics aligned with the Degrowth movement the argumentation about the need for an immediate transformation in our dominant socio-economic system is clear.<br></p><p>Nevertheless, the fundamental criticism of the current system is less apparent related to the knowledge creation process. Questions about how knowledge is created, who the participants are and who benefits from the research results often remain un-reflected.</p><p>The aim of this session is to highlight the need to move away from positivist research toward more democratic, participatory approaches, and present possible ways to co-create knowledge in contributing to the transformation. Through a round table discussion with prominent researchers dealing with degrowth and epistemologically reflecting on Degrowth and academia, we would like to explore participatory research methodologies.<br></p><p>Participatory and action oriented research approaches move away from the objective position of the researcher who controls the process. Instead, they argue for an open and democratic process in which all participants become researchers. The research is a collaborative process of an attempt to improve social processes, do things better and learn about ourselves. Research can offer a better reflective understanding for degrowth activists and practitioners and also deepen the policy recommendations for degrowth. This process also offers the opportunity the originally trained researchers to directly engage in practice, and not only analysing but contributing to the implementation for more sustainability and social justice.<br></p><p>The session will be organised as a participatory round table offering large space for audience contributions. It is a follow up of a session hold in Zagreb Degrowth conference in 2023. It is embedded in the framework of the publication of a book chapter on the topic.<br></p>
