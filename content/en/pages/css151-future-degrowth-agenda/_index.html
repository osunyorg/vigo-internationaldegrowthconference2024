  This interactive closed session will consist of authors discussing and presenting their chapters from the forthcoming edited book A future degrowth agenda: Decolonial voices and interdisciplinary perspective. The session will be bringing degrowth in discussion with critical fields of study often neglected in mainstream degrowth scholarship, such as critical race theory, art, literature, folklore, and indigeneity. The authors/participants in the session will be a combination of researchers and practitioners.

        <p>We currently witness economic crises, wars, poverty, pandemics, all amplified by climate change; and part of a system of exploitation and colonial relations (Federici, 2004; Gilmore, 2002; Pulido, 2017; Robinson, 2000; Sultana, 2021b; Virdee, 2019). As a result of these global, multilayer crises, aggressive and radical opinions have gained popularity; from eco-fascism to extreme right populism and radical leftists.  As one of many critiques to the current oppressive socio-economic system, degrowth as a movement in academia and beyond (Demaria et al., 2013; Kallis et al., 2012a; Martinez-Alier, 2008)  disapproves false solutions to capitalism, such as sustainable growth, green growth, and modes of consumption growth. Thus, against the “green gone wrong” inevitably (Kallis, 2011), Degrowth must incline towards social sustainability or become a more radical political project building a society away from the colonial growth paradigm.</p><p>Despite the recent interest around Degrowth, the relevant debates have focused on certain aspects aiming mostly to ‘defend’ degrowth against the various critiques (e.g., green growth) and to establish a robust degrowth ideology with concrete policies like job guarantees, care income, and less working hours. The decoupling of economic growth and resource consumption, the scenarios for reduction in CO2 emissions, and debates around clean energy have monopolised the interest of degrowth scholars. Other contributions have tried to engage degrowth with topics like tourism, technology, energy, and with other movements like the anarchist movement, feminist studies, climate justice, radical movements from the Global South, solidarity economy and agrarian/rural struggles. All these advances with the numerous publications have created a well-established degrowth literature and have emphasised the plurality of degrowth, which has fostered collaboration across disciplines.<br></p><p>Degrowth has also found its way in political arenas, has affiliated with local governments, and has inspired protests and resistance movements around the world from the yellow vests to the “indignados” and protests for a car-free city. Thus, Degrowth calls for a “repoliticization” of the public sphere and for a social-movement oriented political scene with a focus on care and commons. More recently, however, degrowth scholarship has increasingly underlined how racialized and colonial ideologies are the sine qua non of Degrowth research agendas (Sultana, 2021a; Hanaček et al., 2020).<br></p><p>As the degrowth vision matures, it should move from simply replying to critiques and challenging the current model, to proposing new ideas and new types of relations. We argue that the pluralism, an often-overlooked path, of Degrowth is one of its biggest strengths. Degrowth is not just a political slogan, an activist movement, a policy agenda, or a literature stream. Is all the above and many more. Degrowth is a new way of living, creating, understanding, and organising the world.</p><p>Having this as a starting point, the present closed interactive session will be discussing chapters from a forthcoming book with insights from some of the chapter contributors. The book aims to set an agenda for future research around new and very much needed degrowth paths which can enrich the degrowth discussions and support a degrowth economy.  Many of these approaches, like critical race theory, art, literature, and education can offer decolonial political and social dimensions that strictly technical scientific arguments fail to envision. Inspired by this need, the session aims to create a dialogue between degrowth and new or other well-established, but critical fields of study, and to encourage both scholars and activists to engage with these topics.<br></p><p>The idea behind this proposed special session is to present the initial draft of the forthcoming book “A future degrowth agenda: Decolonial voices and interdisciplinary perspectives” which promises to be a stimulating exploration of the burgeoning field of degrowth. As a compelling response to the prevailing global capitalist system fixated on relentless growth, degrowth offers a revolutionary blueprint for societal change. The session will feature presentations by the authors, each delving into uncharted territories of degrowth, such as art, literature, dance, symbolism, folklore,  and Indigenous voices. This session is a call to expand the boundaries of degrowth discussions and to forge new imaginaries while exploring how degrowth intersects with both established and emerging fields of study, fostering interdisciplinary engagement and dialogue.<br></p><p>During this special session, attendees will have the opportunity to engage directly with our diverse panel of young, dynamic authors hailing from various racial, cultural and research backgrounds. These authors have come together to offer a compelling collection of short essays, each shedding light on uncharted pathways within the realm of degrowth. As we delve into the intersections of degrowth we aim to inspire a vibrant exchange of ideas and foster thought-provoking discussions. By connecting the innovative ideas presented in these essays with the broader discourse on degrowth, we endeavour to forge a future degrowth agenda rooted in decolonial principles and a commitment to interdisciplinary exploration.<br></p><p>This panel directly confronts the theme of "Challenging dominant values, ideologies, and imaginaries" by presenting alternative perspectives within the realm of degrowth. Through their diverse essays, our authors question the prevailing values of endless growth, challenge existing ideologies, and offer fresh insights that encourage a reevaluation of conventional beliefs and practices.<br></p><p><b>Diversity of Potential Contributors and Session Organizers:<br></b></p><p>Some of the (confirmed) presented topics on this session include folklore and traditions by Lucia Muñoz, a PhD candidate based at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, a semiotic analysis of the circular economy as a myth by Sofia Rafaella Greaves, a postdoctoral researcher based at the University of Vigo,  Fashion and Degrowth by Aniko Gal, PhD candidate from University of Ferrera and Dance and Degrowth by Julia Pond, transdisciplinary dance artist and PhD candidate at Kingston University, as well an introduction by the editors, who are the session organizers- three female postdoctoral researchers.<br></p><p><b>Session Plan:</b><br></p><p>There will be 6 chapter presentations of 6 minutes each, along with a 9 minutes introduction to the session (and book) by the session organizers.  The rest of the 45 minutes will consist of a facilitated discussion with the audience. The expected duration of this panel is 90 minutes in order to ensure a fruitful discussion. The session will be beneficial for an audience interested in critical debates with a wish to shape an inclusive, decolonial and pluralistic degrowth agenda. Participants from arts, journalism, movement spaces and decolonial research and activism are especially welcome.</p>
