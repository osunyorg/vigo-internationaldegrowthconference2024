  <p>The degrowth modeling community is growing, with intersections with the integrated assessment modeling (IAM) and macroeconomic-ecological modeling communities. Ongoing work includes how to model degrowth or to use integrated assessment modeling to mainstream degrowth ideals. This is the second of two workshops that together aim to work towards a degrowth community. The session will discuss how to strengthen collaboration in the community, towards improved scientific understanding across different model frameworks. It aims to be a more practical discussion than the session “A strategic 5/10-year plan for a degrowth modeling community” which focuses on bigger strategic impact questions. Topics include: (1) Interoperability: establishing a common data template to facilitate comparisons, and connect research groups. Documentation. (2) Model intercomparison projects: understanding how degrowth models differ. (3) Feeding into IPCC assessments: how to increase policy relevance and increase chance of adoption. (4) Interacting with other modeling communities: especially IAMC and EDITS.</p>

        <p>Optimum number of participants: 20 – 30</p><p>All models aim to be useful simplified representations of reality. For any complex topic no one model holds all the answers, and scenario research is no different. To enhance trust, transparency, and understanding of the modeling frameworks available, qualitative and quantitative studies are necessary across modeling tools. Such a model intercomparison project (MIP) has proved useful in multiple different fields, perhaps most prominently in the field of climate modeling (the well-established and influential “CMIP”), but also in the integrated assessment modeling (IAM) community MIPs have occurred regularly for decades. These MIPs are not just useful to better understand how models relate to each other - they also stimulate learning and discussion between teams, and generally create a community resource of scenario data that can be used for further research.</p><p>With a more diverse model landscape starting to emerge and engage on the topic of how to model degrowth or how to use integrated assessment modeling to mainstream degrowth ideals (as discussed during the last degrowth conference 2023 in Zagreb), the time seems ripe to enhance the robustness and policy-relevance of our tools and learn from each other. This ranges from large-scale integrated assessment models, existing and new(er), but also other models of reduced complexity.</p><p>Separate, but related, is the discussion of what would be good candidates of a potential community model that could see collaboration across the post-growth modeling community. The WILIAM model (outcome of LOCOMOTION project), for instance, was specifically developed to address questions like these and is expected to be available open source by the end of 2023, and could therefore be a candidate. Certainly, there are many other models, such as the country-level EUROGREEN model with a strong focus on the labor market, and other established IAMs are also starting to explore post-growth pathways. This is only a selection for illustration, we do not intend to exclude any existing models. Other points of coalescence of modeling efforts within the degrowth community may be the “A Post-Growth Deal (REAL)” project (e.g. discussed at the 2023 degrowth conference in Zagreb), and the work that will be done under the Europe Horizon call “Broadening the range of policy options in transition pathway analysis”.</p><p>The proposed format of this 90-min session is a mix between 3-6 presentations and roughly 45 minutes of general discussion. The presentations will provide thoughts on what should be the direction for this community, setting out possible steps towards such a goal. They will also discuss lessons learned from other communities, and give an overview of best practices and available tools to facilitate community processes.</p><p>To illustrate the broad involvement of many modeling teams and institutions for this session, we list several additional “supporting organizers”: Roberto Schaeffer (COPPE/UFRJ, Brazil), Vassilis Daioglou (PBL, The Netherlands), Jon Sampedro (BC3, Spain), and Till Jacob Heydenreich (ICTA-UAB, Spain).</p><p>The targeted audience is academics working in, or interested in, post-growth modelling.</p><p>Discussions and presentations will center around:</p><p>(1.a) Connecting research groups by ensuring interoperability and transparency (e.g. common variable templates, documentation standards, etc.): this regards both (1.a) and (1.b) above, since these common standards are needed for collaboration and comparison. Should we align this template with IAMC, i.e. the existing standard of interoperability in IAMs, which has been used by recent IPCC reports, too. Why would we not align with this standard? While they might take some time to set up initially, they might enhance group effectiveness and save total work time of the group to a large extent. What can we learn from the EDITS network, which has been carrying out a ‘model complementarity’ analysis?</p><p>(1.b) Comparisons of different models and understanding what improvements are necessary: Different models are operated by different groups, and they are used to compare them against each other for validation or purposes of understanding the dynamics (of the different models and also “reality”) better. Moreover, different models could be used, also in a strategic sense, for the policy context in a complementary fashion (e.g. for IPCC process, or national scenarios). Intercomparison of models increases scientific understanding, and multiple models coming to similar conclusions could have much more impact! How to judge these models against each other? Importance of model intercomparison for strategic purposes! As building confidence in model results is key to enable it to be taken up in assessments, questions of how to enable comparisons to enable understanding are key. For instance, what would a ‘degrowth modeling protocol’ look like? How can we ensure enough input from the community to establish such protocols? Would it be useful to also simulate Shared Socioeconomic Pathways to be able to compare to scenarios used in recent IPCC reports?</p><p>(1.c) Working together on a specific (community) model: One model is in the center of a community process, and we discuss how to use it together for different purposes (scientific papers, policy scenarios, teaching, media work, activist work, etc.). This is much about software, version management, division of labor, etc.</p><p>(1.d) Steering and organizing a model community: in order to maintain a community, it is useful to exchange notes and present our latest work to each other on a regular basis. Should there be a separate annual meeting, or is everyone happy with going to for instance ISEE, ESEE, and degrowth conferences? Is there a need for communication and steering for community work beyond channels that already exist?</p><p>We thus want to discuss social, modeling, workflow and software management processes to potentially create joint open-source degrowth models and scenario databases - with a broad range of potential users within and beyond the degrowth movement.</p>
