  Supranational Corporations owning, buying and financializing land worldwide whether it be in the global north or south. Industrial agriculture with their heavy use of machinery, chemicals and monocultures is degrading fruitful soil at an immersive rate. By 2050 90 % of worlds topsoil are going to be degraded. Agroecology started as a strategy from the global south emphasizes commoning in agri_culture for a just and solidary transition.<br>Beschreibung was agroecology im globalen Süden ist <br>In this FaDA session we will discuss the problems for strategizing on a solidary basis in agroecology as a careful form of communization &amp; socialization.

        <p>In this open session we are holding an open FaDA space for discussing possible upcoming topics on communization, especially on agroecology. What strategies are needed for a just and solidary transformation on caring for and with land as well as soil. One session will last for 90 minutes, and have a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 50 participants.</p><p>Feminist degrowth scholar_activist with an ecofeminist, marxist feminist, queer feminist and subsistence feminist way of thinking makes clear that degrowth needs to talk about solidarity agroecology since it regenerates life. In caring societies, through a just social and ecological transformation, land must be reclaimed and renowned back by peasant farmers. A socialization as a form of paying colonial debts in order for building up a regenerative, humus-building agri_culture – what we consider as an indispensable practice of earth-care for survival on this damaged planet. Solidarity of the forces of meta-industrial workers like peasants, gatherers, worms, healers, witches, resistant workers is a more than human ecological solidarity that overcomes differences against ecocides and dehumanization of meta-industrial workers.</p><p>This session aims to get together knowledge of activist_scholars, practitioners and academics. The format of a world cafe supports having conversations led by suggested questions for each table regarding possible tactics of agroecology for a caring transformation. We are holding this open session collectively in order to discuss what we can learn from and with current forms of agroecology and what is needed to commonise agriculture in an intersectional and especially gender just manner. A collective format offers the possibility to unlearn hierarchical divisions of expert knowledge hierarchies especially in the topic of agroecology that understands the knowledge of all people in the room as (possible) experts. The dynamic proposed is to introduce 5 tools, tactics or infrastructures at least one for each table in order to discuss possible agricultural transformative pathways. At the tables people will talk about commonalisation, (earth)care, solidarity and labour rights in the field of agriculture. For each table there will be leading discussion questions that will be compiled at the end of the session in order to have an overview of possible agroecological tactics. The aim of this session is to create a space that combines agroecological struggles with degrowth and to understand agroecology as a possible pathway for degrowth strategies. This session is open for all: so let`s socialize!</p>
