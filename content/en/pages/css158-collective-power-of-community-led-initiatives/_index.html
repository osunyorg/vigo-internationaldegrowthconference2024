  ECOLISE has embarked on a consultation and co-creation process on 10 theses towards transformative local development policies together with many partners and member organisations. The goal? Enabling the political positioning at the European level of community-led initiatives for sustainability and climate change to support an enabling environment for communities and our ecosystems to thrive, create resilience and regenerate. The proposed session consists of a 3-step workshop to prototype the implementation of the 10 theses. The first part will enable participants to get to know a bit about who is in the room. The second part will allow participants to learn about the 10 theses. Finally, the third part will encourage participants to prototype the concrete changes they want to collectively launch. Through sharing concrete personal and collective action plans rooted in personal and collective stories, grounded in specific places and communities.

        <p><b>I. Purpose</b></p><p>The purpose of the session is to open the 10 thesis process and manifesto to the wider community, to make collective use of this tool. To that end, we propose to deliver a co-creation workshop of concrete personal and collective action plans rooted in personal and collective stories, grounded in specific places and communities.<br></p><p><b>II. Agenda<br></b></p><p><b>1. Presentation of policy position towards European Green Deal</b><br></p><p>ECOLISE, a European Network of community-led initiatives on climate change and sustainability,  is a coalition of organisations engaged in promoting and supporting local communities across Europe in their efforts to build pathways to a sustainable future.  As a network of community-led initiatives actively engaged in practices that promote so called “Nowtopias” it showcases how to realise the downscaling of material footprints in high-income population groups through collective lifestyle changes. By bringing these organisations together, ECOLISE seeks to establish a common, Europe-wide agenda and a platform for collective action.<br></p><ul><li>Advocacy towards European levels of policy<br><br> </li></ul><p>In 2022/23, ECOLISE has been in conversation with members and partners during a consultation process around 10 theses towards transformative community-led local development. The aim was to trigger conversations and to arrive at a shared policy position towards the European Green Deal. Process partners included ICLEI, Local Governments for Sustainability; Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy Europe; CAN Europe, RIPESS Europe; ELARD; Energy Cities; Arc2020; Climate Change and the Circular Economy Alliance.<br></p><p>A science-policy board accompanied the process, by harvesting participants’ responses, synthesising and systemising their insights as source of transdisciplinary knowledge, and providing input to the facilitated group discussions with their interdisciplinary, research-based perspectives.<br></p><p>The main outcomes of the process will be outlined in the #10 theses manifesto, which will be published at ECOLISE´s Main Policy Event, on the 7th of November 2023, co-organized with ICLEI and the EESC.<br></p><ul><li>Community-led initiatives contributions to degrowth<br><br> </li></ul><p>The 10 theses highlight the potential and needs of community-led initiatives (CLIs) as holistic models of sustainable development, which promote the values of self-sufficiency and localization, regeneration, social justice and equity, self-governance and social cohesion. In line with post-growth scholarship, they describe CLIs as laboratories of socio-ecological experimentation, which offer valuable pathways towards mitigation and adaptation, systemic sufficiency and resilience-oriented collective action. As they de-monetize the local economy and promote common ownership and social solidarity economics, CLIs can be regarded as enablers of a wellbeing economy. By engaging local populations into decision-making processes on place-based developments across sectors they facilitate non-centralised forms of governance that are sensitive to the needs and capabilities of local levels.<br></p><ul><li>Policy Recommendations<br><br> </li></ul><p>Some of the key policy demands that are voiced in the #10theses and during the consultation phase, are the need to support actions to localise the European Green Deal and acknowledge the role of EU policies in promoting community-led local development on sustainability, such as the CLLD/LEADER programme or initiatives led by EU Climate Pact ambassadors. The process also revealed that effective public participation in the definition and implementation of the National energy and climate plans (NECP) and Long-Term Strategies (LTS) are needed. To deliver on these actions, another key policy demand was to make more resources available to CLIs for the implementation of the European Green Deal, addressing the obstacles to access to funding for CLIs.<br></p><p><b>2. Co-Creation workshop: Embodying the transformative, community-led local development at all levels<br></b></p><p>Number of presenters: 3-5<br></p><p>The output from this session is a diverse range of action plans, commitments and coalitions around the 10 theses that gather specific strategies and actions to implement the ten Thesis.<br></p><p>First part: Mapping out our collectives and getting to know each other.<br></p><p>Each participant will be asked to go to one of the several different locations in the room based on which stakeholder group they represent (eg. Activists, NGOs, governmental institutions, communities and citizens, academia, business…).<br></p><p>Then mapping out at which levels of governance participants are mostly involved with such as:</p><p>1) Citizen Dimension / Community-led initiatives<br></p><p>2) Regional level</p><p>3) National level</p><p>4) European Level</p><p>5) Global level: Decolonization and global justice</p><p>Second part: Getting familiar with the 10 theses<br></p><p>The 10 theses will be read as statements. The group will be asked to move closer or further away depending on the extent to which they have engaged in actions related to the theses. The participants will be asked to share further on why they have chosen that particular location.<br></p><p>Third part: Prototyping the 10 theses and transformational action<br></p><p>We will ask the participants to form groups based on the outcomes of the previous exercise and will ask them to create an action plan to implement the thesis through the lenses of the head, the heart and the hands in the context of the 10 theses:<br></p><p>At the level of the head, we will ask participants to reflect on what they think about the thesis and which data, facts, and knowledge are relevant to the thesis to make informed decisions.<br></p><p>At the level of the heart, we will encourage participants to reflect on how the particular thesis makes them feel and what values are reflected in these feelings.<br></p><p>Finally, with regards to the hands, we will ask participants to discuss which concrete action they are taking or commit to take within their community?</p><p>We will ask them to think about the following scenario:<br></p><p>“You have only 5 years left for the new government of the European Union and the urgent need to keep the limit to an increase of a maximum 1.5 degrees target. How can we land the European Green Deal in a socially and ecologically sound manner?  Which experiment/transformation would you explore in your community (eg. Living Labs, initiatives with regards to food sovereignty, biodiversity, energy…)”.</p><p><b>III. Follow-up &amp; Outputs<br></b></p><p>Participants will be encouraged to share their action plans and join ECOLISE’s network through a digital map where people can get inspired on the different actions and find allies in their geographical areas of work.<br></p><p><b>IV. Resources<br></b></p><p>https://communitiesforfuture.org/10-theses-campaign/<br></p>
