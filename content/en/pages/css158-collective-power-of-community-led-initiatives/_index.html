summary: >-
  <p>How can an ambitious Post-Growth European Green Deal be realised through community-led action across Europe?   ECOLISE, the European Network for Community-led Initiatives on Climate Change and sustainability, and its partners, have formulated key ideas and policy demands for transformative change towards a good life for all within planetary boundaries in the “Time for Collective Action Manifesto”.  As a supporting partner of the Beyond Growth conference that took place in May 2023 in the European Parliament, ECOLISE endorses the call of +400 Civil Society organisations and experts for a Post-Growth Europe.  The challenge is immense: the overall aim is to fix a broken system based on infinite economic growth, hyper-individualisation and over-consumption. A sufficiency-based approach to addressing the climate crisis is needed, not least as the IPCC (2022) states that with the right policies, infrastructures and technology to enable fundamental lifestyle and behaviour change, up to 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by 2050. This manifesto is a call-to-action to EU policy makers, as well as non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations and community-led initiatives, to foster transformative community-led development across Europe.   The purpose of this session is to introduce participants to the work of ECOLISE and its action programme “Communities for Futue” explore synergies with Degrowth, and facilitate a discussion on how to effectively promote the objectives of a Post-Growth European Green Deal with community-led initiatives at the heart.   In the beginning, the organisers will provide an introduction to ECOLISE, including its community-led approach and its relationship with Degrowth This will be followed by an interactive session on policy recommendations that promote transformative, community-led local development in Europe. Through ECOLISE’s engagement in advocacy at EU levels, it possesses critical experience and partnerships to work towards realising a post-growth policy agenda at EU levels. This transdisciplinary knowledge is to be brought into a fruitful exchange with findings from research on viable degrowth policies.</p>
