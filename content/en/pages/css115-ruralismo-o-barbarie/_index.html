  The Degrowth Movement and scholarship has thus far paid very little attention to the rural and the agrarian questions. In this special session, we want to showcase the rural as the foundation for social-ecological just transitions, and to challenge the dominant city-driven values, ideologies, and imaginaries of progressive social movements (including degrowth). We consider the rural as an appropriate space for reinventing subsistence economies, which put social reproduction at the forefront. Rural space and peasants hold and apply regenerative and social-reproductive practices that are intrinsically linked to resilience, and sustainable local livelihoods from the perspective of social-ecological metabolism. While none of these aspects automatically implies socio-ecological justice – past, present, and future – the potential of rural space for degrowth transformations must urgently be acknowledged within the Degrowth Movement, especially in the face of the deeply exploitative metabolism – interlinked with industrial capitalism – of the urban metropolitan areas.

        <p>The Degrowth Movement and scholarship has thus far paid very little attention to the rural and the agrarian questions (see e.g., Gerber, 2020). In this special session, we want to showcase the rural as the foundation for social-ecological just transitions, and to challenge the dominant city-driven values, ideologies, and imaginaries of progressive social movements (including degrowth). We consider the rural as an appropriate space for reinventing subsistence economies, which put social reproduction at the forefront. Rural space and peasants hold and apply regenerative and social-reproductive practices that are intrinsically linked to resilience, and sustainable local livelihoods from the perspective of social-ecological metabolism (e.g., Mies &amp; Bennholdt-Thomsen, 1999; Salleh, 2009; Barca, 2020). While none of these aspects automatically implies socio-ecological justice – past, present, and future – the potential of rural space for degrowth transformations must urgently be acknowledged within the Degrowth Movement, especially in the face of the deeply exploitative metabolism – interlinked with industrial capitalism – of the urban metropolitan areas.</p><p>In addition to theoretical, methodological, and historical approaches, we wish to share the many ongoing practices, cultures, and initiatives that already practice what we could call rural and agrarian degrowth. Most importantly, we wish to start picturing the re-balancing acts of the current one-sided and exploitative urban-rural relations, where the key agents for degrowth and sustainability are considered to be, for instance, the various village and peasant economies, subsistence- and eco-cultures, social movements, ecovillages, and small holder communities, around the world.<br></p><p>Thus, we ask the session contributors to highlight, imagine, and/or to theorize, based on past and present movements, practices, and agrarian alternatives, what could agrarian degrowth be from the perspectives of horizontal organizing, gender equality, low tech and low material throughput, local autonomy, and sustainable livelihoods? And taking these perspectives into account, what could be considered as rural degrowth and its material and cultural underpinnings? In addition, we seek to amplify the marginalized voices of various rural communities and movements, and based on their examples to build pluriverse alternatives for the peaceful co-existence in the rural and struggles against the urban-industrial world. Our approach is social scientific, and participatory, as many of us have hands-on experiences from the various rural communities, change initiatives, and subsistence activities.<br></p><p>We ask:<br></p><ul> <li>What is the role of the rural and subsistence in the social-ecological transformations for degrowth?</li> <li>Based on your case studies and experiences, what are the rural and agrarian degrowth alternatives like?</li> <li>What are the possible activities and strategies to re-center the rural, and to rebalance rural-urban relations?</li> </ul><p><b>Format:<br></b></p><p>We have invited six presenters to participate in this closed session. The format is a conventional 90 minutes panel, where each presenter first introduces themselves, and gives approx. 5 min introduction to their topic or research case. After this we will continue the panel by answering the questions above, and by complementing each others’ contributions (approx. 35-40 min). The final 20-25 min is reserved for the questions and comments from the audience.</p><p><b>Abstracts (in alphabetical order):</b><br></p><p><b>Les Soulevements de la Terre’ or the building of a down-to-earth Degrowth Movement<br></b>Adrián Almazán</p><p>Degrowth continues to face the challenge of imagining political paths of materialization. Within the movement this debate is open and different answers to this defy are offered. Some people propose to focus our efforts in the construction of urban electoral majorities that would allow the massive implementation of Degrowth public policies. On the contrary, some of us defend that we can and must build communalist political hypotheses in order to advance towards ruralist degrowth scenarios. From our point of view, the only way to escape from our imperial mode of living and to decouple from colonialism, patriarchy, industry and capitalism is to take the rural world as both a metabolic and political inspiration and a privileged political setting for degrowth political action.</p><p>To exemplify this position I will present the case of 'Les soulevements de la terre'. This French movement has been showing for more than five years that it is possible to build a down-to-earth Degrowth Movement. That is to say, to put at the center of the struggle the defense of the agrarian sphere, the defense of the territory and the construction of communal autonomy. All this, moreover, without incurring in political isolation and, in addition, developing a strong capacity for confrontation and conflict. As I will defend, this movement is maybe the most promising example of the kind of political hypothesis that could allow us to transform our societies fast and deep enough to avoid the global crisis in which they are immersed.<br></p><p><b>News from now-here: rural degrowth lessons from a place that doesn’t exist<br></b>Donatella Gasparro</p><p>Molise is a small Southern Italian region counting under 300 thousands inhabitants, spread across small towns sprinkled on its hilly and mountainous territory. In Italy people say that Molise doesn’t exist. Yet it exists, and its depopulating rural villages are treasure chests full of potential lessons for degrowth, where glimpses of persisting subsistence peasant practices and community economies could kindle larger degrowth transformations.</p><p>I conducted preliminary ethnographic research in two small hilltop towns where most inhabitants own land and make oil, make tomato sauce, wine, sausages, harvest wood and tend to vegetable gardens. Despite the inevitably complex social dynamics of an emptying and ageing small town, inhabitants engage in dense exchanging and gifting, and traces of communal resource management persist. Through this territory’s case, I argue for a degrowth that looks at these peripheries as potential centres for relearning how to be human in a degrowth world.<br></p><p>Building on a critique to the lack of attention to rurality in degrowth literature and bridging it with materialist ecofeminist subsistence approaches, I argue that “Souths-within-the-North” like rural Molise, places considered marginal, backwards, or non-existent in the growth race of industrial capitalist modernity, can be starting points for larger degrowth transformations, providing familiar examples of life otherwise within the “West”. At the same time, these territories can be concrete localities and communities where to experiment (again) territorial economies for a degrowth future.<br></p><p><b>Spatialising fundamental human needs to local places for degrowth-based transformations<br></b>Julia Grosinger</p><p>Research on degrowth strives to conceptualise to what extent fundamental human needs can be fulfilled beyond market-based means to achieve a good quality for all. Re-localising, thus re-establishing the relations of and among humans within social-ecological systems is one possible pathway to degrowth-based futures.</p><p>Rural zones can present potential learning examples of real existing degrowth. Non-material aspects that are central to degrowth utopias, such as conviviality or solidarity appear to be more pronounced in rural zones than in more dense areas. Publicly accessible places where people engage with their surroundings and other people constitute crucial elements to a good quality of life for present and future generations.  <br></p><p>An analysis to what extent local places can fulfill fundamental human needs can help to identify and to critically assess possible strategies for degrowth in rural zones. We define places as socially produced areas that are structured along biophysical (locations), social (locales) and symbolic (sense of place) dimensions. Yet they are dynamic within time, even space and across and within societies.<br></p><p>The Catalan town Navas (Spain) serves as an example of contemporary post-industrial living practices within the larger capitalist regime. Navas, built in the eve of the thriving Catalan cotton industry in the mid of the 19th century owed to hydropower providing river in an otherwise rural area. With the last factory closing in 1990, inhabitants had to find alternative ways of how to engage within their social-ecological system.<br></p><p>In my empiric, human geographical based research I spatialise fundamental human needs by walking interviews. People identify relevant places for their quality of life beforehand and show them to me. In a second step local stakeholders discuss these spatially mapped places and revisit some of them. The aim is to collectively identify to what extent these places can contribute to degrowth futures. I hope to contribute to the debate surrounding the role of local places and rural zones for a good quality of life as well as to rethink appropriate methodologies for the local scale.  <br></p><p><b>Inhabiting the rural: An approach to food production in non-growth logics<br></b>María Montesino</p><p>The rural environment, as a complex and dynamic space in a continuous process of change, has become in recent years a focus of strategic social, cultural, environmental and political interest. Local peasant knowledge and emerging eco-social imaginaries and practices related to agroecological and regenerative food production in rural areas contribute to generate resilient models that facilitate a degrowth transition in the Global North.</p><p>A perspective will be developed based on the paradigm of inhabiting the rural, an analysis of the reality that integrates the actors that inhabit it (human and non-human), spaces (natural, cultural), the ways of relating to each other (eco-dependence, environmental affectivity, power relationships, conflict), from different theoretical approaches (new ruralities, eco-feminism, decoloniality, political ecology). The purpose of this research is also to explain how communal lands are linked to degrowth processes in rural areas. First of all, due to its historical potential of equal distribution of land (a land owned by everybody and nobody at the same time). Secondly, because communal lands facilitate a wide range of social, ecological and cultural practices in rural territories which directly connect humans, animals and ecosystems in non-growth logics.<br></p><p>Finally, a methodological toolbox based on rural participatory dynamics and communal imaginaries based on land management developed in Cantabria (a region in northern Spain) will be shared with the aim of facilitating the implementation of regenerative food production and marketing systems.<br></p><p><b>Necessity and freedom: Radical rural and the Self-sufficiency Institute in Nurmes, Finland<br></b>Toni Ruuska, toni.ruuska@helsinki.fi</p><p>In critical geography, and in critical agrarian studies, the rural, in the 21st century, has been conceptualized to uphold a radical dimension. In the context of post-productivism and over-urbanization, some individuals and communities already explore and dwell the rural in ways that could be considered as anti- or post-capitalist. In this presentation, the secluded village of Rasimäki and the village’s recently founded Self-sufficiency Institute (Omavaraopisto) in Northern Karelia, Finland, are interpreted as being representatives of the radical rural.<br></p><p>The founders of the Institute, and the portrayed neo-self-provisioners of the study, are depicted as actors who consider the acts of self-provisioning and alternative enskilment as an enablers of ethical and sustainable life, at the fringes of contemporary capitalist society. The process of becoming more autonomous from the destructive structures of the capitalist economy, was considered, rather than a means of struggle, an enabler of wellbeing and ethical life, and a step away from stress, depression, and worry, which were sensations and emotions that were linked to the surrounding society at large.<br></p><p>The pupils and I also considered that the acts of self-provisioning may offer autonomy and freedom, but perhaps in a different way than people usually think about them. While the rural and self-provisional life itself ties oneself to a place, and to a piece of land, the acts of self-provisioning have the potential to cut ties to the destructive and stressful contemporary society. This way the step towards self-sufficiency can be emancipatory for the radical ruralians.<br></p><p><b>Conceptualizing post-figuration: how to rethink rural traditions for a degrowth future<br></b>Lucía Muñoz Sueiro, luciamunozsueiro@gmail.com</p><p>Within the productivist leftism discourse, entrenched in a linear and evolutionary temporal framework, subsistence practices, land struggles and traditional popular culture typical of rural areas are often associated with the past. This past, in turn, is loaded with associations of nostalgia, conservatism and even reactionism. In contrast, the non-productivist left with its critique of the idea of progress, where degrowth finds its ideological footing, opens up the opportunity to develop a different perspective and use of the past and tradition. Drawing on Walter Benjamin's dialectical vision between the past and the future, I propose the concept of "post-figuration" to refer to the project of dialogue with the past and tradition that can give rise to ignite today, in Benjaminian terms, "revolutionary sparks". If prefiguration consists in bringing elements of the desirable future into the present, post-figuration would consist in bringing inspiring elements of the past into the present or the desirable future.<br></p><p>As a way of nurturing this post-figuration project for degrowth, my research explores living elements of rural Iberian popular culture, usually disdained, that challenge dominant conceptions of governance, work and leisure: “concejos abiertos” (open councils), or bodies of direct democracy that have existed for centuries; the “hacenderas”, or traditional forms of work sharing; and rural carnivals as rituals of subversion that have existed since time immemorial. These traditional legacies contain living elements that inspire alternative ways of life rather than a unilateral future of capitalist growth. I rethink the relationship between tradition and degrowth using these examples and showing how a future-oriented socio-ecological transition can be reconfigured as a "returning forward".</p>
