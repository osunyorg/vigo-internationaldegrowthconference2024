summary: >
  This session will bring together members of the MEND network and collaborators with the aim of further catalysing energy and action to transform management education to address the issues created by a growth economy and transition through degrowth to post growth. The MEND network has this year published its living manifesto to achieve this aim and scaled out to create new nodes and include new members having been established in 2021. The aim of these sessions is twofold: 1) An interactive ‘Reflection’ session to bring new and old members together to learn from each other’s discussions and 2) An ‘Action’ session during which MEND members will co-ordinate and plan further action in line with MEND’s aims. For example, writing work towards the production of a text to guide management educators in their pedagogical approach and teaching methods in embedding degrowth and post growth in their teaching.

        <p>In this closed track we dedicate time and space to a growing network of MEND and to scaling the action of MEND whose aims are:</p><ul>  <li>The creation of space for critical dialogue, meaningful exchanges and compassion in higher education institutions.</li>  <li>Catalysing more groups and individuals to self-organise and enact changes in management education.</li>  <li>The transformation of students’ experiences, colleagues’ pedagogical practices and our institutions to prioritise human and planetary wellbeing above greed and profit.</li>  </ul><p>The track is divided into two interactive sessions, which are described below, with a total duration of 90 minutes:</p><ul>  <li>  <b>Session 1 </b>will bring together members of the MEND network which has scaled out to include new members and nodes of management educators in 2023-24. The aim is to bring together the MEND network to share insights and experiences from their respective ‘learning sets’ with a view to establishing further actions to address MEND’s aims. Learning sets are reflective discursive sessions that MEND network members undertake in small groups throughout the year, informed by and to inform their pedagogic practice. This session will have a focus identified by the MEND network ahead of the session – this may be institutional challenges and opportunities; structures and modes of degrowth learning etc. </li>  <li>  <b>Session 2</b> will follow on from session 1 and focus on action undertaken by MEND members towards its aims. For example, producing outputs that support management educators seeking to embed post-growth and degrowth into their teaching. These outputs will benefit the MEND network but are also intended to be of much wider relevance. The aim is to build on existing plans to produce textbooks and/or other pedagogical materials in a writing workshop session. The session will enable MEND members to share existing plans to produce writing and materials that support management education for degrowth/post-growth and support the development of new materials. This session may also focus on other actions, such as research to support pedagogic innovation and success in teaching degrowth/post-growth perspectives or other action area which emerge from the preceding reflection session.</li>  </ul><p>Both sessions will be facilitated by the organisers listed above but will be highly interactive with all participants contributing as equals. We expect a minimum of 15 participants and a maximum of 30 to enable small group working and a high level of discursive interaction. </p><p>We are happy for the two sessions in the track to either take place consecutively on one day or to run one day apart – the key requirement being that the session is by invitation only and comprises the same group to build on discussions. We plan to also meet informally outside of formal conference sessions to further support discussion and interaction.</p><p>The contribution to Degrowth and Ecological Economics that the sessions will make are captured by the Living Manifesto of MEND, which was produced in June 2023 and we reproduce for information below.</p>

      notes: >-
        <p><b>A Living Manifesto for Management Educators Navigating Degrowth (MEND)</b></p><p><b>MENDing represents….</b></p><p>A vision of a different future where organisations define success in more meaningful ways than a blind pursuit of growth. A future where authentic scholarship and meaningful learning are not antithetical to personal development and recognition.</p><p>Management education and practice that recognises the significance of diverse forms of work and organisations, with a broader set of goals such as wellbeing and meaningful work in contrast to a narrow pursuit of growth and productivity. </p><p>Academics frustrated by the ideological demands of “the business school” to produce knowledge and students that support growth at all costs.</p><p><b>MENDing is motivated by:</b></p><p>Dissatisfaction with academia’s commodification and the marketisation of knowledge.</p><p>Grief as we bear witness to social and ecological breakdown.</p><p>Urgency given the scale and devastation of social and ecological issues.</p><p>Desire to contribute to reimagining and reorganising for a sustainable economy.</p><p>Duty to nourish responsible citizenship in learners.</p><p>Hope that things can, must and will be different.</p><p><b>MENDing means practising:</b></p><p>Reciprocity: to work together to transform management education. To exercise substantive rationality, bringing values into the classroom for critical discussion, and to build trust-based relationships with students and colleagues. </p><p>Democracy: to actively participate in decision-making. MEND is democratically run by our members and decisions are made by consensus, whereby agreement is reached between all members and the group is committed to finding solutions that each individual member can actively support or accept.   </p><p>Responsibility: to own the impact of our actions, without externalising blame. To provide guidance and support to colleagues and students to the best of our ability, while challenging practices which are detrimental to our own wellbeing and that of our colleagues and students.</p><p>Openness: to question what is, starting from our own practice, and find new ways to teach and learn. To explore different ways of organising, different content and methods; and to open up spaces for dialogue. </p><p><b>Our approach:</b></p><p>We practise reflexivity and dialogue; asking questions, instead of providing convenient but uncritical answers. </p><p>We question taken-for-granted assumptions, instead of reinforcing self-fulfilling prophecies.  </p><p>We combine reflection with action, starting with our available means. </p><p>We consider education as an empowering opportunity for transformation, rather than a way to mould students into the current system. </p><p>We look for dialogue, not conflict. </p><p><b>MENDing hopes to achieve:</b></p><p>The creation of space for critical dialogue, meaningful exchanges and compassion in higher education institutions.</p><p>Catalysing more groups and individuals to self-organise and enact changes in management education.</p><p>The transformation of students’ experiences, colleagues’ pedagogical practices and our institutions to prioritise human and planetary wellbeing above greed and profit.</p>
