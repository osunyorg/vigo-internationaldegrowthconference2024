    CSS118. A Just Transition to Circular Economy
  summary: >-
    <p>This session aims to showcase the insights and outcomes of the Just2CE project. The Just2ce project assesses the current state of transition towards the circular economy (CE) in relevant economic sectors and analyses possible transition scenarios, as well as their outcomes and impacts. In doing so, it sheds light on the following research questions: which theoretical frameworks inform the dominant and alternative perspectives on CE? Which ideological positions underpin them? Which are the industrial sectors driving CE research and policy developments, and which ones are instead neglected? Which stakeholder groups are included and in which roles, and which are excluded and why? The workshop will present the output of all six project work packages and will enable an interactive discussion on the key insights and recommendations they bring. It will also provide a space to discuss the project's future, how to best disseminate its outputs, and plan for its closing.</p>

The Just2ce project assesses the current state of transition towards the circular economy (CE) in relevant economic sectors and analyses possible transition scenarios, as well as their outcomes and impacts. It identifies the key factors that can stimulate or hinder this transition. Natural resources are extracted and transformed into products, which are eventually discarded. As many natural resources are finite, it is important to keep materials in circulation for as long as possible. This makes the transition to circular economy more vital than ever, but it leaves a lot of open questions on the shape and form of this transition such as: which theoretical frameworks inform the dominant and alternative perspectives on CE? Which ideological positions underpin them? Which are the industrial sectors driving CE research and policy developments, and which ones are instead neglected? Which stakeholder groups are included and in which roles, and which are excluded and why? The EU-funded JUST2CE project sheds light on these questions. It explores the economic, societal, gender, and policy implications of the circular economy paradigm. The project's findings will explore how to ensure democratic and participatory mechanisms when designing and managing such technology. The project is divided into 6 work packages (WP). WP1 set the theoretical basis for the project by conducting a comprehensive review of the diversity of current CE applications and CE discourses and approaches. WP2 identified key enablers and barriers to the implementation of CE practices based on 10 in-depth case studies of CE implementation in Europe and Africa. WP3 developed a framework to design 'Responsible Circular Economy Practices', which led to the creation of new tools and methods oriented to industry, SMEs, coops, and community-based initiatives to consider social, environmental, and economic aspects in the design of circular business models. WP4 created a Decision Support System that enables users to explore the global nature of supply chains and how issues relating to justice and circularity are embedded within them. WP5 developed a multi-regional macroeconomic model to analyse the potential social and environmental impact of various CE scenarios and policies. WP6 has conducted horizontal activities to communicate, disseminate, train, and exploit the project’s achievements, activities, and results.  The session will be organized as follows:  <br> Introduction to the session and the Just2CE project (15 minutes)  <br> Presentation of the outcomes of each work package of the Just2CE project (6 work packages, 10 minutes of presentation, and 5 minutes of Q&A for each WP: a total of 90 minutes).  <br> Short coffee break (15 minutes).  <br> Presentation of key insights and policy recommendations from the project (30 minutes).  <br> Discussion on the core synergies and actions needed to finalize the project and expand its outreach and impact (30 minutes) </p>
