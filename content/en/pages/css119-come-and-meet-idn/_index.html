        <p>The International Degrowth Network (IDN) was officially launched at the 4th International Assembly of the Degrowth Movement held in Zagreb (Croatia) in August 2023. Among its key purposes is enabling efficient, effective and coordinated work and international cooperation between degrowth-affiliated groups and supporting strategies and actions that implement degrowth policies and ways of living.</p><p>The IDN is a sociocratic body striving to catalyze a radical transformation around the world. Its governance structure connects the many existing degrowth groups through a number of bodies that are called “Circles”. There are Continental Circles which bring together individuals and groups based in a common region (Asia, South America, etc.)  and Working Group Circles that are based on a common theme or function (Communications, Activism, Research, etc.) Members can also share resources, updates or news on potential actions/campaigns or new research.  </p><p>The 10th International Degrowth Conference in Pontevedra is an excellent opportunity to present IDN to local and international audiences who will be present at the Conference and acquaint them with the activities of this recently established Network. The session will be organized by 4 members of the Organizing Circle, which is the organizing body of IDN dealing with administrative and structural issues, and will showcase short presentations on the Working Group Circles and Continental Circles by their current Coordinators. Shortly after the presentations we will split up the audience into smaller groups where they can join a more informal conversation on a Circle that they are interested in. This will allow for more familiarity on the current work of the IDN and give everyone a chance to connect with each other at a personal level (which is particularly important when most of the work happens online!)</p><p><b>Aims of the session:</b></p><ol> <li>Present key information on the International Degrowth Network (IDN) to all interested participants</li> <li>Discuss purpose, structure and membership of the IDN and address any questions from participants</li> <li>Support individual participants and groups who are interested in becoming members of IDN to effectively join the network<br> </li> </ol><p>This will be an interactive session where participants will be able to ask questions and engage in a discussion on any aspects of the work of the IDN. Participants will also be informed on how they can join the IDN in case they wish to do so. Approximately 6-8 presenters from the IDN are expected, while we would expect 40-60 persons as participants. Translation into Spanish will be provided in case of need. The optimum duration of the session is 60 minutes.</p>
