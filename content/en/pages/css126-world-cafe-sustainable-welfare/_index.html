summary: >-
  <p>How do we provide sustainable welfare for all without undermining planetary wellbeing? Eco-social policies tackling ecological and social problems in simultaneous and integrative manner will play crucial roles in post-growth societies. Overcoming the growth-dependency of current welfare states requires new ideas and perspectives. Using the world-café method, researchers, practitioners, and other conference participants can meet through this interactive session and discuss innovative proposals of eco-social policy such as working time reduction, universal basic services, maximum income, and green job guarantee. Researchers with expertise in these proposals will act as the café hosts and the participants will discuss transformative potentials as well as problems and barriers in implementing them.</p>

        <p>Sustainable welfare as a new paradigm in social policy deals with the problem of how to provide human welfare without undermining planetary wellbeing, by studying policy solutions that aim to create synergy between social justice, ecological sustainability, and democratic participation (Fritz &amp; Lee, 2023). Eco-social policies are the concrete policy instruments which translate the goal of sustainable welfare into practice. With this interactive session we aim to offer a creative and welcoming opportunity for exchange among researchers, practitioners and the public. Using the world-café method, we would like to introduce and discuss the innovative proposals of eco-social policy that so far largely remain in the realm of academic discussions. Our session contributes to facilitating a researcher-led participatory policy process where new imaginaries of a post-growth future are articulated in terms of concrete eco-social policies for sustainable welfare.</p><p><br><b>World-café in action</b></p><p>To begin the session, the session organizers will welcome everyone and briefly introduce the concept of sustainable welfare and eco-social policies. We will then introduce the topics that will be up for discussions during the session, explain the timetable and what the café hosts and café guests are expected to do during the session (15 mins introduction). Next, all participants will be seated around 5 different tables (max. 4-5 participants for each table, plus one presenter which is the café host). The café hosts will briefly introduce specific eco-social policy instruments such as <b>working time reduction, maximum income, green job guarantee, universal basic income, and universal basic services</b>. After that, discussions take place in each table where the café guests discuss the following questions: i) what concrete actions, norms and values will be promoted when a given eco-social policy is implemented? ii) what problems and weaknesses of the instruments are there, and what barriers will there be in implementing the policy instrument? After these first round of discussions around the tables, the café hosts remain at the same table, but the guests move on to another table to reflect on the same questions on a different eco-social policy. After three consecutive rounds of discussion (60 min in total), all café participants and hosts will have open discussions together (20-30 mins).</p><p><b>Café participants</b></p><p>The café hosts - presenters that will be seated at each table with designated eco-social policy instruments - will be selected by the organizers of the session prior to the conference. We will invite scholars and researchers with expertise on the theme and who are interested in and committed to the role of public deliberation processes in policy research for transformative change.</p><p>As to the café guests, we welcome a mix of researchers, practitioners, and representatives of the local population to this interactive session. We especially welcome people who are active in local civil society organizations in Pontevedra and other cities/communities that work with issues such as climate justice, just transition, wellbeing economy, local commons project, etc. Please get in touch with the session organizers if you are interested and if you have any questions (email: <a href="mailto:Jayeon.lee@socwork.gu.se">Jayeon.lee@socwork.gu.se</a>; <a href="mailto:kajsa.emilsson@soch.lu.se">kajsa.emilsson@soch.lu.se</a>; <a>martin.fritz@uni-jena.de</a>). Interested conference participants are welcome to participate as café guests as well. We aim at recruiting at least 15 to 20 confirmed participants including the café hosts and guests prior to the conference. We will therefore leave a possibility for other conference participants (10 to 15 persons) to join the café spontaneously</p><p><b>The Organizers</b></p><p>Jayeon Lee, PhD in Social Work, works as a senior lecturer at the Department of Social Work at University of Gothenburg, in Sweden. Her research interests include operationalizing sustainable welfare using participatory methods and studying public support basis for new eco-social policy instruments. </p><p>Dr. Martin Fritz works as a PostDoc at the Institute of Sociology at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany. His current position is within the project ‘Mentalities in flux’ which deals with people’s perceptions, dispositions and everyday practices in relation to social-ecological transformations. He is also interested in sustainable welfare, degrowth and analyzing eco-social attitudes and values.</p><p>Kajsa Emilsson, PhD in Social Work, works as a researcher at the School of Social Work Lund University, Sweden. Her research interest lies primarily in the intersection between social policy and climate change, including eco-social risks and public attitudes related to sustainable welfare. Her current research is focused on the regulation and legitimization of economic elites in social-ecological transformations, but also on eco-social risk exposure in relation to socioeconomic context. </p>
