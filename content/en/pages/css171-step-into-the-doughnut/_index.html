    CSS171. Step into the Doughnut: An interactive session
  summary: >-
    <p>This interactive session offers an embodied introduction to the Doughnut of Social and Planetary Boundaries that combines movement, playful connections, and personal experience. Participants will be invited to move around the space, self-organising collectively to form and reflect upon embodied notions of overshoot, shortfall and dynamic balance, and to spark connections in pairs that link the social and ecological dimensions of the Doughnut. There may be singing :)</p>

The activities are designed for 20-60 participants, who will be invited to move around an open space in different configurations (i.e. forming circles, groups, and pairs). The session takes inspiration from the observation that when we physically move and shift our bodies, it increases our ability to move and shift our thinking. The overall aim is to draw attention to how we are all embedded and interconnected with other people and the rest of the delicately balanced living world, while appreciating the unique personal journeys and skills of the people around us.The first activity invites participants to form a human doughnut by dividing the group into an outer ‘planet’ ring and an inner ‘people’ ring. By moving and coalescing in different configurations, participants will collectively form embodied notions of ecological overshoot, shortfall shortfall and dynamic balance. Participants will also be invited to consider distinctions between healthy and unhealthy boundaries.The second activity uses individual A4 cards of each of the Doughnut’s social dimensions (e.g. food, education, etc.) and ecological dimensions (e.g. climate change, biodiversity loss, etc.). One card is handed out to each participant, who will be invited to move around the room, find a partner, and jointly establish a connection between the two dimensions. Once the pair creates a connection, they move on to find another partner and establish a different connection between dimensions. After 15 minutes or so, participants can reflect on this process as a group, sharing any interesting or unexpected connections that came up.The third activity uses the A4 cards to divide participants into four groups corresponding to the four lenses of a framework that ‘unrolls’ the Doughnut to open up space between the social foundation and ecological ceiling for envisioning a safe and just future here – wherever here happens to be – without losing sight of the fact that each place is inextricably linked to the rest of the world. The framework is based on a core question to ask every ambitious place: “How can this place become a home to thriving people, in a thriving place, while respecting the wellbeing of all people, and the health of the whole planet?” Each of the four groups focuses on a part of the overarching question at the core of the Doughnut Portrait, and participants will be invited to consider unique considerations of ‘their’ lens, its connections with other lenses, and to share reflections on broader opportunities and challenges for transformative action.The fourth activity invites participants to reform the human Doughnut and to wrap up, potentially by singing a song together :)</p>
