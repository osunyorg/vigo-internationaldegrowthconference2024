With a population of over 80,000 inhabitants, Pontevedra has gained recognition for its  urban model that prioritizes pedestrianization and sustainability .  The city has received several prestigious awards over the last ten years, including the  UN-Habitat Award  in 2014 and hosting  Placemaking Europe  in 2022.  Pontevedra's commitment to the principles of degrowth is evident in the improvements it has made to quality of life, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability .

Participants will also have the opportunity to  explore the natural beauty of the nearby Rías Baixas region , which features stunning coastlines, lush landscapes, and renowned vineyards. </p>  <p> More information about the city  <br>   <br>Visit Pontevedra:  https://www.visit-pontevedra.com/en/ (in Galician, Spanish, and English) Pontevedra City Council:  https://www.pontevedra.gal/  (in Galician) Terras de Pontevedra:  https://terrasdepontevedra.org/es/  (in Galician and Spanish) Wikipedia:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontevedra (in English)</p>  <p> What to see around  <br>   <br>Pontevedra is situated in the province of the same name, within an area known as the "Rías Baixas". This area of the autonomous community of Galicia is renowned for its mild climate, gastronomy, and beautiful landscapes, both along the coast and inland. Here are some of the nearby places worth visiting:   <br> Combarro : A small village located a few kilometres from Pontevedra, known for its numerous “hórreos”. These traditional Galician constructions, typically made of stone and raised on pillars, were used to store and preserve food away from moisture and animals.   <br> O Morrazo : A peninsula nestled between the estuaries of Vigo and Pontevedra offering a multitude of beaches, both large and small, ranging from family-friendly to more secluded. In the westernmost part of O Morrazo is Cabo Home, the closest land point to the Cíes Islands.  <br> Vigo :The largest city in the region, just a 15-minute train ride from the center of Pontevedra. June is an ideal time to visit, with pleasant weather and a vibrant atmosphere.   Don’t miss a stroll along the port and the old town and catch a stunning sunset from a beachside bar while enjoying views of the  Cíes Islands.  <br> Atlantic Islands - Cíes, Ons and Cortegada : These idyllic islands in the Atlantic Ocean are havens of marine and terrestrial biodiversity. They offer pristine beaches, hiking trails, and lighthouses. Please note that visits to Cíes and Ons have limited access and/or require prior permission.  <br>  <br> Santiago de Compostela : Although not part of the Rías Baixas, Santiago de Compostela is a must-visit city as the capital of Galicia and a renowned destination for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago (O Camiño, as known in Galicia). The city’s cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (since 1985) and holds great historical and cultural significance.  <br>  <br> These are just a few examples, but the options are abundant. Those fortunate enough to extend their stay will have countless choices to suit their preferences: the sea, the countryside, beaches, mountains, cities, villages, culture, and sports. If you have any questions or need recommendations, the local  organizing team will be happy to assist you. </p>
