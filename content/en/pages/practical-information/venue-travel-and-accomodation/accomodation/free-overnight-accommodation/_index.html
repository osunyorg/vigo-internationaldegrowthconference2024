        <p>The City Council of Pontevedra has provided us with a covered place near the conference venue where participants can stay for free during the conference week. Those interested in this option <b>must first <a href="https://esee-degrowth2024.uvigo.gal/en/practical-information/registration/academic-activities/" target="_blank">register for the conference</a>, and then request this service via <a href="https://forms.gle/4A7bBmRAkhfhbDKA6" target="_blank">this form</a></b>. Participants must bring their own sleeping material (mat and sleeping bag). The site has toilets and washbasins, but the showers are located elsewhere (nearby) and have limited opening hours.</p><p>The facility is guarded by a security service with access control. A <b>deposit of €50</b> is required for the reservation as a guarantee of proper use of the facility and compliance with the rules.
