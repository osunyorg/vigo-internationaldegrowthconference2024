A deposit of €50 is required for the reservation as a guarantee of proper use of the facility and compliance with the rules. This deposit will be refunded at the end of the stay.Useful information:<br><br>Where: Recinto Ferial - Pazo da CulturaLocation: https://maps.app.goo.gl/foq3xYZu3Xyvj6BQ9<br><br><br>Number of places: 100<br><br>Dates: From June 16 to 23.<br><br>Shower facilities: Pontevedra University Sports Pavilion (Monday to Friday from 9 am to 2 pm). https://maps.app.goo.gl/7oaedUmteWWPjDeBA<br><br><br>Application form: https://forms.gle/4A7bBmRAkhfhbDKA6<br><br><br>Information: payment_esee-degrowth2024@uvigo.gal
