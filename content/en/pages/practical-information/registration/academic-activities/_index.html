    <p>Conference fees  <br>   <br>The <br>registration for the International Conference ESEE-Degrowth 2024 will open  on 1 March, 2024 at 8.00 p.m. (CET) .  </p>  <p> The fees will <br>be the following: </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>*  If you choose the option "ISEE/ESEE member", you will be asked to provide proof of current ISEE/ESEE membership  during the registration process  (membership invoice, payment receipt, confirmation email...). If you wish to become a member of ISEE/ESEE, you can register and pay the membership fee here  -  https://ecolecon.eu/membership/ -  before registering for the conference If you are already an ISEE/ESEE member, you can download your membership invoice here:  https://theisee.wildapricot.org/Sys/Profile</p>  <p> What does the fee include?  <br>   <br>These fees <br>include the  attendance to all the conference sessions  (both parallel <br>and plenary) and the  coffee breaks . Lunch <br>is not included in the conference fee, but participants can opt to add meals <br>during registration for an additional €18 per day/lunch. The menus will only include VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN <br>options, and both products and service will be in line with the  principles of the conference . WHY IS LUNCH NOT INCLUDED IN THE FEES? We opted <br>not to include meals to avoid imposing additional costs on attendees, who may <br>prefer to bring their own food or explore other options for lunch. In this <br>regard, there are external cafeterias on the university campus offering <br>non-vegetarian menus for those who prefer it. However, since these services are <br>not managed by the conference organizers, we cannot provide any additional indication <br>on prices, menus, etc.  What happens if I don’t book lunch and then I change <br>my mind?  If you <br>don’t book lunch in advance and later change your mind, there may be limited <br>extra tickets available during the event, but availability cannot be guaranteed <br>for those who haven't booked in advance.  SOLIDARITY DONATIONS During the <br>registration process, attendees have the option to contribute to a solidarity <br>fund through a donation. This fund is specifically aimed at assisting <br>participants who face significant financial barriers to attending the <br>conference, especially those without adequate support from their institutions. <br>The donations collected will directly support the launch of a  Funding Open <br>Call , designed to subsidize conference costs for the most financially <br>disadvantaged attendees. </p>  <p> Attendees can <br>choose from three donation levels: </p>  <p>  <br> Bronze: €10  <br> Silver: €30  <br> Gold: €50  <br> </p>  <p>Participants <br>are welcome to select more than one donation option if they wish to contribute <br>a larger amount.</p>  <p> How to register  <br>   <br>Registration <br>must be done through the ConfTool platform:  https://www.conftool.com/esee-degrowth2024/   </p>  <p> Starting March 1, <br>2024, at 8.00 p.m. (CET)  an option to register will automatically appear for <br>users logging into their accounts. If you do not have an account, you must <br>create one to proceed with registration. Information about the registration process can <br>be found here:  https://www.conftool.net/en/user-documentation/registration-for-participation.html  </p>  <p> How to pay  <br>   <br>There will <br>be 3 payment options:    <br> Bank transfer *: this is the payment method recommended by the organisers. Those who choose this payment method must perform the bank transfer within 7 days after their registration, and always on a date prior to April 10, 2024, if they are presenting a paper at the conference, or May 6 in case they are not presenters, and send a copy of the transfer receipt within the same period to  payment_esee-degrowth2024@uvigo.gal .  <br> Paypal* : this option also allows credit <br>card payment. Please note that in some countries participants will have to <br>create a (free) PayPal account during the payment process.  <br> Stripe* : this is a credit card processing <br>service for Visa, MasterCard and American Express, available in many European <br>countries, the US, Canada and Australia. <br>* Please note that transaction fees can be <br>applied by the payment suppliers</p>  <p> Key Dates  <br>   <br>  <br> March 1 : registration opening  <br>  <br> March 31 : early bird registration deadline  <br>  <br> April 10 : free* cancellation deadline  <br>  <br> April 22 : registration and payment deadline <br>for those presenting at any of the conference sessions  <br>  <br> May 6 : registration and payment deadline <br>for attendees  <br> </p>  <p> * Those who <br>cancel before this date will be refunded the 90% of the payment. 10% of the <br>amount will be retained for administration costs.</p>  <p> Contact information  <br>   <br> registration_esee-degrowth2024@uvigo.es  – For any doubt related to the <br>registration process.  <br> payment_esee-degrowth2024@uvigo.gal  – For doubts related to the <br>payment. <br>To avoid overloading the organisers, please read all the information on this page carefully before contacting us.</p>
