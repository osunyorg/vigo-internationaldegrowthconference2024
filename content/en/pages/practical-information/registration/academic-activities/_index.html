    <p>Conference fees  <br>   <br>The <br>registration for the International Conference ESEE-Degrowth 2024 will open on 1 March, 2024 at 8.00 p.m. (CET). </p>  <p>The fees will <br>be the following: </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>* If you choose the option "ISEE/ESEE member", you will be asked to provide proof of current ISEE/ESEE membership during the registration process (membership invoice, payment receipt, confirmation email...).If you wish to become a member of ISEE/ESEE, you can register and pay the membership fee here - https://ecolecon.eu/membership/- before registering for the conferenceIf you are already an ISEE/ESEE member, you can download your membership invoice here: https://theisee.wildapricot.org/Sys/Profile</p>  <p> What does the fee include?  <br>   <br>These fees <br>include the attendance to all the conference sessions (both parallel <br>and plenary) and the coffee breaks.Lunch <br>is not included in the conference fee, but participants can opt to add meals <br>during registration for an additional €18 per day/lunch. The menus will only include VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN <br>options, and both products and service will be in line with the principles of the conference.WHY IS LUNCH NOT INCLUDED IN THE FEES?We opted <br>not to include meals to avoid imposing additional costs on attendees, who may <br>prefer to bring their own food or explore other options for lunch. In this <br>regard, there are external cafeterias on the university campus offering <br>non-vegetarian menus for those who prefer it. However, since these services are <br>not managed by the conference organizers, we cannot provide any additional indication <br>on prices, menus, etc. What happens if I don’t book lunch and then I change <br>my mind? If you <br>don’t book lunch in advance and later change your mind, there may be limited <br>extra tickets available during the event, but availability cannot be guaranteed <br>for those who haven't booked in advance. SOLIDARITY DONATIONSDuring the <br>registration process, attendees have the option to contribute to a solidarity <br>fund through a donation. This fund is specifically aimed at assisting <br>participants who face significant financial barriers to attending the <br>conference, especially those without adequate support from their institutions. <br>The donations collected will directly support the launch of a Funding Open <br>Call, designed to subsidize conference costs for the most financially <br>disadvantaged attendees.</p>  <p>Attendees can <br>choose from three donation levels:</p>  <p>Bronze: €10 <br>Silver: €30 <br>Gold: €50</p>  <p>Participants <br>are welcome to select more than one donation option if they wish to contribute <br>a larger amount.</p>  <p> How to register  <br>   <br>Registration <br>must be done through the ConfTool platform: https://www.conftool.com/esee-degrowth2024/ </p>  <p>Starting March 1, <br>2024, at 8.00 p.m. (CET) an option to register will automatically appear for <br>users logging into their accounts. If you do not have an account, you must <br>create one to proceed with registration. Information about the registration process can <br>be found here: https://www.conftool.net/en/user-documentation/registration-for-participation.html </p>  <p> How to pay  <br>   <br>There will <br>be 3 payment options:  <br>Bank transfer*: this is the payment method recommended by the organisers. Those who choose this payment method must perform the bank transfer within 7 days after their registration, and always on a date prior to April 10, 2024, if they are presenting a paper at the conference, or May 6 in case they are not presenters, and send a copy of the transfer receipt within the same period to payment_esee-degrowth2024@uvigo.gal. <br>Paypal*: this option also allows credit <br>card payment.
