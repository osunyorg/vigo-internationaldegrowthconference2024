        <p>These fees include the <b>attendance to all the conference sessions</b> (both parallel and plenary) and the <b>coffee breaks</b>.</p><p>Lunch is not included in the conference fee, but participants can opt to add meals during registration for an additional €18 per day/lunch. The menus will only include VEGAN AND VEGETARIAN options, and both products and service will be in line with the <a href="https://esee-degrowth2024.uvigo.gal/en/the-conference/about-the-conference/principles/" target="_blank">principles of the conference</a>.</p><p><b>WHY IS LUNCH NOT INCLUDED IN THE FEES?</b></p><p>We opted not to include meals to avoid imposing additional costs on attendees, who may prefer to bring their own food or explore other options for lunch. In this regard, there are external cafeterias on the university campus offering non-vegetarian menus for those who prefer it. However, since these services are not managed by the conference organizers, we cannot provide any additional indication on prices, menus, etc. </p><p><b>What happens if I don’t book lunch and then I change my mind? </b>If you don’t book lunch in advance and later change your mind, there may be limited extra tickets available during the event, but availability cannot be guaranteed for those who haven't booked in advance. </p><p><b>SOLIDARITY DONATIONS</b></p><p>During the registration process, attendees have the option to contribute to a solidarity fund through a donation. This fund is specifically aimed at assisting participants who face significant financial barriers to attending the conference, especially those without adequate support from their institutions. The donations collected will directly support the launch of a <b>Funding Open Call</b>, designed to subsidize conference costs for the most financially disadvantaged attendees.</p><p>  </p><p>Attendees can choose from three donation levels:</p><p>  </p><ul> <li><b>Bronze: €10</b></li> <li><b>Silver: €30</b></li> <li><b>Gold: €50</b></li> </ul><p>  Participants are welcome to select more than one donation option if they wish to contribute a larger amount.</p>
