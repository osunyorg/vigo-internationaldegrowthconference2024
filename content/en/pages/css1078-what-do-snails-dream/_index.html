summary: >
  Degrowth futures require fundamentally different systems of provisioning, consumption, and sociality. Creative thinking skills are crucial toward this reconfiguring process, but have been systematically undermined by the modern world and its homogenization of values. We seek not to build an equally homogenous blueprint for a Degrowth future, but to celebrate and strengthen the capacity for group creativity as Degrowth imaginaries may still be bound by a creativity crisis of current systems. We are thus proposing an Interactive Contribution to collectively conceive new ideas for social configurations, and to digest wild imaginaries in a fun and unconventional activity. Our goal is to nurture the Degrowth pluriverse, celebrating methodologies that evoke divergent thinking and collective imagination.<br><br>This Interactive Contribution employs constraint-based brainstorming (Gould et al., 2023) to creatively co-imagine Degrowth futures and potential paths to achieve these. This facilitation technique enables the iterative generation of ideas in a fun and engaging way. It starts with a challenge for the group to brainstorm - examples could be the structures of a post-growth transportation industry or community responses to mental health crises. Next, facilitators announce a prompt that constrains the challenge in some absurd or extreme way, e. g. the solutions must involve magic, or be something a six-year-old would design. Prompts are intentionally crafted to induce participants to suggest ideas that would otherwise be rejected or unfeasible, to limit conventional responses, and to facilitate radical creativity. Activities involve sharing, listening, writing, and drawing, and groups switch with each prompt. A second phase promotes the contemplation and synthesis of disparate ideas into thematic elements of future imaginaries. Broader group reflection allows ideas to snowball into new, more coherent visions. This approach encourages a playful collaborative environment to experiment with ideas that break the status quo, liberating radical imagination. The process and results will be recorded to be disseminated to wider audiences and all session participants will share co-authorship. Our goals include the experimentation of plural methodologies for collective imagination, the co-creation of Degrowth futures, and the publication of our work.
