        <p>In August 2020, was published Exploring Degrowth: A Critical Guide (Pluto Press, Vincent Liegey, Anitra Nelson). This book is an invitation to explore what is degrowth since its birth in 2002. Around a provocative slogan, décroissance, launched in France stared a movement first inspired by post-development and in the continuity of alter-globalist movements. Degrowth was later translated into English and became a flourishing academic field.</p><p>The book was supposed to be launched and presented at the Manchester ISEE-Degrowth joint Conference. But Covid happened... Since then, other books, academic articles have been published, debates on degrowth have been opened in mainstream medias, in politics. Degrowth was largely debated in the Beyond Growth conference at the EU Parliament in May 2022. A new International degrowth movement is under construction with its first assembly in Zagreb in August 2022.<br></p><p>But Exploring Degrowth is still going on: how to analyse the critics, feedbacks, updates and perspectives around degrowth in the last years. What are the pending controversies, the gaps, the expectations around degrowth?<br></p><p>The co-authors of Exploring Degrowth propose a participatory session to analyse, debate on the last dynamics from diverses perspectives.<br></p><p>The session will be introduced with an short introduction of Exploring Degrowth book with a reflexion on the last developments around degrowth and followed by a participatory discussion.<br></p><p>It is the continuity of a fruitful conversation made in Zagreb Degrowth Conference where feedbacks will also be presented and debated.</p><p>The format will be later adapted depending on the potential number of participants (fish bowl, world cafe, discussion, etc.).<br></p>
