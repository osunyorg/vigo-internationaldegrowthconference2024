    CSS132. Forging masculinities for pleasurable postgrowth futures
  summary: >-
    <p>A participatory, experiential 90-minute workshop examining how dominant and subordinate masculinities are intertwined with economic growth, and exploring personal and collective strategies that can be used towards transformations compatible with post-growth futures.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>  <br> Contributions format : interactive  <br>  <br> Keywords : privilege, non-hegemonic, care, transformation, politics  <br>  <br> Related track(s) : 2. Theoretical perspectives and debates around STI and degrowth / postgrowth,  / 10. Challenging dominant values, ideologies, and imaginaries  <br>  <br> Organizers : Smith Khanna, Pierre (Coventry University, UK; Research & Degrowth International); Zografos, Christos (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Spain; Research & Degrowth International); Žďárský, Tadeáš (NaZemi, Brno Czech Republic) </p>  <p> Full description  <br>   <br>Gender systems are assessed as technologies for producing and reproducing humans and eco-social worlds; gendered knowledges, norms, and practices are identified in the generation and application of all other technologies. Enactments of hegemonic masculinities are related to green growth and climate denial (ecomodern, techno-optimist, and petro masculinities), revealing shifts towards more convivial and caring gender subjectivities and dynamics as one of degrowth’s greatest challenges.  In this participatory, experiential 90-minute workshop we will explore manifestations of masculinities' relation to extractivism, fossil fuels and economic growth, as well as their relation to care, regeneration, environmental activism and degrowth. It will explore personal and collective strategies that can be used towards transformations compatible with post-growth futures, with an emphasis on how transformations occur from hegemonic breadwinner/ecomodern masculinities towards ecological/sustainable masculinities as well as identify the pitfalls such transformations are likely to experience. This workshop is open to self-identifying men and non-binary males . Acknowledging the historical tendency for men to lean heavily on women and gender non-conforming people for emotional support, this workshop is aimed at disrupting this pattern and foster a space in which men can take responsibility for such care work and process of transformation amongst themselves</p>
