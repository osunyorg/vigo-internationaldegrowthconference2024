    CSS133. Just Transition: in the Factory, in the Fields (cases and reflections from Italy)
  summary: >-
    <p>Just Transition assumes the need for sustainable policies to tackle social inequalities. In particular, the role of workers is key. Against the background of two national research projects, the session assesses a global debate and discusses its implication in the Italian context. Some theoretical issues are debated - most notably, the notions of class composition, form of life, prefiguration, agriculture 4.0 - and some case-studies analyzed - for example the GKN occupied factory in Campi Bisenzio (Florence) and the Civitavecchia plan for turning a coal plant into a hub of renewable energy production. The session aims to discuss how are the ecological transition and digitalization redefining work, how different degrees of workers’ involvement and (contentious and prefigurative) interference into the production processes e.g. by means social-mobilization can contribute to different trajectories of ecological transition, and what are the challenges and trade-offs involved, and the role of contextual factors.</p>

Political economy and political ecology / 11. Enabling radical change and institutional transformation  <br>  <br> Organizers : Leonardi, Emanuele (University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy); Asara, Viviana (University of Ferrara, Italy) </p>  <p> Full description  <br>   <br>The session aims to present the results of two ongoing national research projects dealing with the topic of just transition in two crucial sectors: agriculture and industry.  The first project is “ JUST TRANSITION IN THE FACTORY: WORKERS’ MOBILIZATIONS AND PARTICIPATORY INNOVATION IN EMERGENT ITALIAN EXPERIENCES ". Transition to a more sustainable way of living has come to the fore as a no longer deferrable task, as testified by the recent acceleration in political action at European and national level (Next Generation EU/PNRR) and confirmed once more by the 2022 IPCC report on climate change. The key drivers of transition remain however controversial. In ideal-typical terms one can distinguish between a top-down, elite-driven, and a bottom-up, social mobilizations-based, understanding. The former takes for granted the continuity of the industrial model in force, and the related division of labour between public and corporate actors, scientists and technicians, workers and the public of citizens/consumers, assuming the unavoidability of social, especially occupational, costs. The latter is inspired by a “prefigurative” approach, aimed at enacting change at societal level by reorganizing social and socio-material  relations in the here and now of everyday life. This often entails alternative ways of doing science, a repurposing of technologies, and in general more horizontal decision-making processes. The factory seems the preserve of an elite-driven approach to transition, particularly in the key economic sectors led by large industrial groups. However, some cases have been recently emerging in Italy where workers, in cooperation with technical staffs and external professionals, unions and other local/translocal social actors and institutions, try to take over the transition process by elaborating alternatives that point to refashioning at once the relations and the means of production, saving jobs and skills while rethinking the purposes of production. We might talk in this case of a participatory or “co-production” approach, in the sense of a collaborative orientation that breaks with traditional role divisions and of a rethinking of the means, relations and goals of production in terms of reciprocal consistency. The project will carry out an in-depth study of some of these experiences, in the sectors of energy and automotive production, set in contrast with elite-driven ones belonging to a same sector. This to avoid any prejudicial assumption about the social and/or ecological advantages of upstream vs. downstream transition processes. The method adopted is therefore comparative, and based on a fourfold qualitative technique of inquiry: secondary analysis of media and grey literature, interviews, focus groups and participant observation. Case histories will be constructed and updated also by way of an Actor-network description approach, to capture the role of elements such as technological devices or regulatory frameworks. Theoretically, given the potentially disruptive character of participatory experiences, the concept of “form of life” is applied for the first time in this field, complementing traditional approaches on work, occupations and industrial relations. The second project is " DIGITAL FOOD AND JUST TRANSITION. SUSTAINABILITY AND LABOUR IN AGRICULTURE 4.0. "  Brief description: Digitisation - especially as precision agriculture, e-commerce and smart farming - is seen as a core innovative solution for agri-food systems. Its aim is to promote the transition to agriculture 4.0. The Italian Recovery Plan fully embraces this definition, placing agriculture 4.0 as a key component of Mission 2 “Green Revolution and Ecological Transition”. Accordingly, the transition to an economy 4.0 is seen as an opportunity for agri-food systems to undertake effective and efficient transformation that increases productivity while fostering sustainability and food security. These objectives are even more crucial in the context of multiple global crises, from the 2008 food and financial crisis to the COVID-19 pandemic and the more recent Ukrainian war. Faced with such critical challenges, policies have oriented towards a triple-win vision, whereby the development of agricultural systems drives an integrally beneficial transition: for climate, for food security, and for social wellbeing. The digitisation of agriculture can be described as a further step in the incorporation of technology within agri-food systems. Yet, this process is not limited to the introduction of technological artefacts; it also consists of a set of practices through which new actors come into play, new interactions are established, and new arrangements arise - transforming the social and ecological structure of agri-food production. This project aims to examine the growing entanglements between the digital economy and the Italian agri-food system. It pays particular attention to the transformations in the organisation of labour and to the dynamics through which different types of innovation affect the agri-food chain: from inputs selection to harvesting, to logistics and distribution. More solid knowledge should strengthen public decision-making by interconnecting different levels and types of insight into the impacts and possible trade-offs of the digitisation processes. More solid knowledge is equally necessary to link such processes to the perspective of Just Transition (JT), whose adoption is rapidly spreading world-wide. Thus, the project builds on the assumption that agri-food offers a vantage point to understand the role of the digital economy in sustainable socio-economic transition processes, and related hurdles and opportunities. Theoretically, it draws on multiple literatures: a) JT, climate justice and environmental labour studies; b) rural sociology and agrarian studies; c) sociology of innovation and sustainable transition science. Methodologically, it combines different qualitative approaches: secondary analysis of media and grey literature; policy and dataset analysis; stakeholder analysis; in-depth case histories, applying sectoral knowledge systems mapping, interviews, and participant observation. The session contributes to both ecological economics and degrowth in that it discusses both theoretical issues which are at the core of their interests (e.g., Just Transition) and empirical case studies which may have practical implications.</p>  <p> PRESENTATIONS  <br>Transition thinking. A typology and an application Luigi Pellizzoni 1   (Scuola Normale Superiore) & Barbara Bastos (Scuola Normale Superiore) Ecological transition is generally seen as requiring profound <br>changes, affecting the organisation of production, relations with the market <br>and the territory, technology, consumption patterns and the distribution of <br>burdens and benefits linked to all this. Changes that, before being <br>implemented, must be thought out, imagined. This contribution seeks to define <br>coordinates that make it possible to analyse different trajectories of <br>transition. Firstly, the type of change to which the notion of transition <br>refers has to be specified. Secondly, transition is to be placed in the framework <br>of the modern spatiotemporal topology, considering in particular how the <br>connection with the future has become increasingly loose and unpredictable, <br>concerning both innovation and its social context, and the way they affect one <br>another. The idea of ‘disruptive innovation’ evokes utopian or dystopian <br>imaginaries. However, the paper claims that this framework is misleading and <br>that an alternative, more effective analytical dyad can be developed by <br>building on the Foucauldian notion of heterotopia. While the features of the <br>latter are well-known, those of its conceptual opposite, provisionally called <br>‘autotopia’, have to be specified. Based on that, a typology will be developed and <br>tested by applying it to the automotive sector. This in two ways: first by mapping <br>the imaginaries of transition at stake; second, using data from an ongoing <br>research, by analysing the dilemmas faced by workers and solidary experts in <br>their attempt to save a factory from closure according to a project of relaunch <br>that has been changing according to the evolution of the struggle and the <br>broader circumstances. Just Transition as a Participatory Labour Strategy: The Former GKN Dispute Emanuele Leonardi 2  (University of Bologna) & Jacopo Nicola Bergamo 3   (University of Vigo & Post-Growth Innovation Lab) The concept of Just Transition (JT) in the context of ecological transformation has been the subject of criticism and reflection in the social sciences. Originally defensive, it now implies broader union involvement. However, the focus on employment mainly concerns the quantity and quality of jobs. To shed light on the role of worker participation in production and the labour process, the example of the former Gkn dispute in Campi Bisenzio (FI) is proposed as a model of worker participation, centred on worker knowledge and economic democracy. In short, the research investigates how JT can be a participatory labour strategy. Through the case study of the former Gkn, it is highlighted how the process of ecological conversion of the plant, including social mobilization and the drafting of projects for ecological-productive reactivation, can pave the way for a “bottom-up” ecological transition, capable of harnessing the transformative potential of the convergence between worker knowledge and expertise for public policies and for union research and action. Digitalising Italian Agriculture? Challenges and potential of a Just Transition perspective Maura Benegiamo (University of Pisa) This paper aims to discuss the idea of Just Transition in the Italian agricultural context, examining the possible challenges posed by the prospects of digital transformation of agricultural systems. Digitalization -in the idea of precision agriculture, agriculture 4.0 and smart farming- is claimed as a key transition strategy for agrifood systems threatened by multiple social and ecological crises. According to the FAO, for example, the adoption of technologies based on the principles of automation, data economy and input digitalization is a key innovative solution to promote the transition to a more climate and economically efficient agriculture 4.0. On the other hand, scholars in political ecology and critical agrarian study have criticized the digital agriculture paradigm and pointed out the impacts of such dynamics on the transformation of agricultural labour, threatened by the expropriation of knowledge, loss of control, and diminished autonomy, stressing the risk of new forms of land expropriation and concentration of monopolies. Digital agriculture has been read as a new form of extractivism, exacerbating rather than addressing ecological destruction. Moreover, debates on digital automation have emphasized the material relations that permeate digital technologies, including their uneven reliance on unequal, racial, and gendered relations of production and dispossession, arguing for the importance of interrogating the colonial imaginaries of labour conveyed by top-down imaginaries of automation. Against this backdrop, the presentation examines the implications of a Just Transition perspective, outlining the transformative potential of such claim and main challenges its implementation encounter. The just transition in energy production: Inter-movement interactions in the transition from coal to renewable energy Viviana Asara (University of Ferrara) & Marco Caligari (University of Ferrara) Sticking to decarbonization targets implies a phase-out of all coal power plants in the next decades. However, decarbonization involves complex social processes and conflicts and it is by no means guaranteed that such an energy transition be 'just', i.e. oriented not only towards environmental sustainability, but also towards achieving public health, decent work, social inclusion and poverty eradication goals (Mcllroy et al 2022). In this sense, the case of the ENEL (state-controlled multinational manufacturer and distributor of electricity and gas, and the second largest electric utility company by revenue in the world) coal-fired power plant in the city of Civitavecchia (Torrevaldaliga Nord), 70 km north of Rome, is significant in the national and international context, both as a potentially emblematic case of 'just' energy reconversion, and for the processes of mobilisation and collective action involved so far. On 28 March 2024 the Ministry of the Environment authorised the construction of a floating wind farm off the coast of Civitavecchia, which intends to replace the coal-fired power plant. This result represents the culmination of a process that began in January 2020 following a mobilisation that succeeded in involving workers and union organisations, technicians and environmental associations. The aim of our essay is to present the preliminary results of a research still in progress in the Civitavecchia area, analysing the trajectories of the energy reconversion and the way in which an inter-movement coalition has been constituted and a negotiating position built. In particular, we intend to answer the following questions: how have inter-movement interactions between workers, trade unions and the climate justice movement in the Lazio region evolved? How have a coalition and a shared negotiating position been built, and what tensions and conflicts has they entailed? How do workers' organisations intend to address the employment issue in relation to decarbonisation in Civitavecchia?  Our research builds on participant observation, documents analysis and interviews undertaken with technicians, workers, trade unions, environmental associations and other civil society organisations in the city of Civitavecchia.</p>
