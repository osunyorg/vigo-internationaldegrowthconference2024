summary: >
  Just Transition assumes the need for sustainable policies to tackle social inequalities. In particular, the role of workers is key. Against the background of two national research projects, the session assesses a global debate and discusses its implication in the Italian context. Some theoretical issues are debated - most notably, the notions of class composition, form of life, prefiguration, agriculture 4.0 - and some case-studies analyzed - for example the GKN occupied factory in Campi Bisenzio (Florence) and the Civitavecchia plan for turning a coal plant into a hub of renewable energy production. The session aims to discuss how are the ecological transition and digitalization redefining work, how different degrees of workers’ involvement and (contentious and prefigurative) interference into the production processes e. g. by means social-mobilization can contribute to different trajectories of ecological transition, and what are the challenges and trade-offs involved, and the role of contextual factors.

        <p>The session aims to present the results of two ongoing national research projects dealing with the topic of just transition in two crucial sectors: agriculture and industry. </p><p>The first project is “<b>JUST TRANSITION IN THE FACTORY: WORKERS’ MOBILIZATIONS AND PARTICIPATORY INNOVATION IN EMERGENT ITALIAN EXPERIENCES</b>".</p><p>Transition to a more sustainable way of living has come to the fore as a no longer deferrable task, as testified by the recent acceleration in political action at European and national level (Next Generation EU/PNRR) and confirmed once more by the 2022 IPCC report on climate change. The key drivers of transition remain however controversial. In ideal-typical terms one can distinguish between a top-down, elite-driven, and a bottom-up, social mobilizations-based, understanding. The former takes for granted the continuity of the industrial model in force, and the related division of labour between public and corporate actors, scientists and technicians, workers and the public of citizens/consumers, assuming the unavoidability of social, especially occupational, costs. The latter is inspired by a “prefigurative” approach, aimed at enacting change at societal level by reorganizing social and socio-material  relations in the here and now of everyday life. This often entails alternative ways of doing science, a repurposing of technologies, and in general more horizontal decision-making processes. The factory seems the preserve of an elite-driven approach to transition, particularly in the key economic sectors led by large industrial groups. However, some cases have been recently emerging in Italy where workers, in cooperation with technical staffs and external professionals, unions and other local/translocal social actors and institutions, try to take over the transition process by elaborating alternatives that point to refashioning at once the relations and the means of production, saving jobs and skills while rethinking the purposes of production. We might talk in this case of a participatory or “co-production” approach, in the sense of a collaborative orientation that breaks with traditional role divisions and of a rethinking of the means, relations and goals of production in terms of reciprocal consistency. The project will carry out an in-depth study of some of these experiences, in the sectors of energy and automotive production, set in contrast with elite-driven ones belonging to a same sector. This to avoid any prejudicial assumption about the social and/or ecological advantages of upstream vs. downstream transition processes. The method adopted is therefore comparative, and based on a fourfold qualitative technique of inquiry: secondary analysis of media and grey literature, interviews, focus groups and participant observation. Case histories will be constructed and updated also by way of an Actor-network description approach, to capture the role of elements such as technological devices or regulatory frameworks. Theoretically, given the potentially disruptive character of participatory experiences, the concept of “form of life” is applied for the first time in this field, complementing traditional approaches on work, occupations and industrial relations.</p><p>The second project is "<b>DIGITAL FOOD AND JUST TRANSITION. SUSTAINABILITY AND LABOUR IN AGRICULTURE 4.0.</b>" </p><p>Brief description: Digitisation - especially as precision agriculture, e-commerce and smart farming - is seen as a core innovative solution for agri-food systems. Its aim is to promote the transition to agriculture 4.0. The Italian Recovery Plan fully embraces this definition, placing agriculture 4.0 as a key component of Mission 2 “Green Revolution and Ecological Transition”. Accordingly, the transition to an economy 4.0 is seen as an opportunity for agri-food systems to undertake effective and efficient transformation that increases productivity while fostering sustainability and food security. These objectives are even more crucial in the context of multiple global crises, from the 2008 food and financial crisis to the COVID-19 pandemic and the more recent Ukrainian war. Faced with such critical challenges, policies have oriented towards a triple-win vision, whereby the development of agricultural systems drives an integrally beneficial transition: for climate, for food security, and for social wellbeing. The digitisation of agriculture can be described as a further step in the incorporation of technology within agri-food systems. Yet, this process is not limited to the introduction of technological artefacts; it also consists of a set of practices through which new actors come into play, new interactions are established, and new arrangements arise - transforming the social and ecological structure of agri-food production. This project aims to examine the growing entanglements between the digital economy and the Italian agri-food system. It pays particular attention to the transformations in the organisation of labour and to the dynamics through which different types of innovation affect the agri-food chain: from inputs selection to harvesting, to logistics and distribution. More solid knowledge should strengthen public decision-making by interconnecting different levels and types of insight into the impacts and possible trade-offs of the digitisation processes. More solid knowledge is equally necessary to link such processes to the perspective of Just Transition (JT), whose adoption is rapidly spreading world-wide. Thus, the project builds on the assumption that agri-food offers a vantage point to understand the role of the digital economy in sustainable socio-economic transition processes, and related hurdles and opportunities. Theoretically, it draws on multiple literatures: a) JT, climate justice and environmental labour studies; b) rural sociology and agrarian studies; c) sociology of innovation and sustainable transition science. Methodologically, it combines different qualitative approaches: secondary analysis of media and grey literature; policy and dataset analysis; stakeholder analysis; in-depth case histories, applying sectoral knowledge systems mapping, interviews, and participant observation.</p><p>The session contributes to both ecological economics and degrowth in that it discusses both theoretical issues which are at the core of their interests (e. g., Just Transition) and empirical case studies which may have practical implications.<br></p><p>90 minutes is the optimum duration. At least half an hour will be dedicated to collective discussion.<br></p>
