    CSS136. Book project: economic growth between progress, dependency and coercion
  summary: >-
    <p>This Special Session discusses a current book project on growth imperatives and growth dependencies. The purpose of the anthology is to make this research field, which is still poorly established scientifically, more visible and to provide researchers and the interested public with an overview of the quite diverse approaches developed to date. In this session, we will first introduce the overall framing of the book. After that, four chapters of the book will be presented: 1) Cultural time horizons of the pursuit of growth; 2) Two types of growth imperatives and their normative differences; 3) Employment and growth (in)dependence; 4) How does Japan tame social conflict without growth? The presentations will be followed by approx. 30 minutes of discussion</p>

The purpose of the anthology is to make this research field more visible and to provide researchers and the interested public with an overview of the quite diverse approaches developed to date. The book currently comprises twenty-three contributions by thirty-two authors from different disciplines, including economists, philosophers, and political scientists. The book comprises three parts. The first part deals with conceptions of growth as they developed in the history of ideas, became structurally embedded in society and consolidated into concrete ideals of progress. The second part deals with theories of growth imperatives and the question of whether a non-growing capitalist economy inevitably leads to severe economic crises. The third part on growth dependencies explores whether various socio-economic systems can maintain their respective functions without growth. Under what conditions, for example, can employment remain constant without growth? And how can welfare-state services continue to be financed at the same level in the absence of growth? The proposed Special Session includes four contributions. At the beginning of the session, the editor will present the overall book project. In the following, four book chapters are presented by the authors. The presentations will be followed by approx. 30 minutes of discussion. 1)  Clutural time horizons of the pursuit of growth Presenting author: David Bockelt This contribution examines the connection between the perception of time and history and economic growth throughout the history of economic ideas. From the ancient cyclical concept of time to apocalyptic and eschatological ideas of the Middle Ages to the modern idea of an open future through Enlightenment, philosophy of history and secularization, the evolution of time concepts and their corresponding economic models are examined. It shows how these ideas hindered or fostered the pursuit of growth, to the point where economic growth has become the main paradigm for economic theory. The "Limits to Growth" study marks a turning point in that it highlights the negative consequences of unchecked growth and triggers increased criticism of the growth paradigm. This criticism reflects a potentially closing future that restricts individual freedom of action and the scope for social action. Recently and as a reaction to the polycrises of late modernity, discussions about alternative economic models such as post-growth and degrowth, as well as political initiatives to promote sustainable practices, raise the question of whether a new understanding of time, history and awareness of finiteness can promote a transformation of the economy and society towards greater sustainability. 2)  Two types of growth imperatives and their normative differences Presenting author: Tobias Vogel I examine the normative differences of two possible growth imperatives for the political sphere. First, I analyze labor-productive and capital-intensive technological progress. This technological progress not only pushes for growth to maintain jobs and finance rising capital costs, but also constitutes the systematic and permanent source of growth. Second, I analyze the development of rising income inequality insofar as it triggers a process of mirror-image wealth and debt accumulation that burdens the economy with rising profit claims that can only be permanently serviced by further growth. The latter type of growth imperative, unlike the former, is not based on an equivalent source of growth, but can at the same time have a growth-inhibiting effect. I argue that this difference is normatively relevant because the political capacity to shape growth processes is compromised when the economic system's capacity to grow does not keep pace with its need to grow. Under these conditions, economic policy operates under the constraint of avoiding imminent economic crises instead of using the enormous capacities of current economic systems primarily to address environmental and social problems. 3)  Employment and growth (in)dependence Presenting author: Stefanie Gerold, Steffen Lange, Katharina Bohnenberger In the public discourse, creating or maintaining jobs is one of the most prominent arguments why economic growth is needed. The positive correlation between economic growth and employment, also known as Okun’s law, has repeatedly been observed, although the strength of this relationship is subject to great variety. In this contribution, we analyze how the growth dependence of employment can be overcome, or at least mitigated. We first argue that a post-growth transformation would itself diminish Okun’s law. This is because labor productivity growth often relies on increasing energy and material inputs. Redirecting technological change towards improving energy and resource productivity would lower labor productivity and thus growth pressures. In addition, we discuss a series of policies proposed in the post-growth literature to lessen the growth dependence of employment, including work sharing schemes, job guarantees,  and promoting jobs with low productivity (growth). Lastly, we explore policies that aim at decoupling employment from livelihoods, thus making individuals less dependent on wage income to meet their needs. These policies include universal basic income, universal basic services, as well as more self-sufficient lifestyles. 4)  How does Japan tame social conflict without growth? Presenting author: Riwan Driouich Research on growth dependencies/imperatives is still nascent. Theorizations are strongly debated; empirical applications are scarce. This chapter contributes to the former and extends the pool of the latter. I introduce a new theorization of the concept of growth dependency by framing it within Regulation Theory (RT). An institutionalist school of thought rooted in Marxist economics, RT underscores the pivotal role of so-called institutionalized compromises in shaping the dynamics of an economy. They are sociopolitical arrangements that mediate and tame the conflict between social groups with opposed interests. I argue that a growth dependency/imperative arises when growth is functional to the perpetuation of a compromise, id.est., to the taming of social conflict. I use this theorization to make sense of the (relative) resilience of contemporary Japan to 30 years of low GDP growth. Despite it being sluggish, the country features low rates of bankruptcy and unemployment, and a limited risk of fiscal crisis despite high public debt. I argue that Japan’s (relative) ability to “manage without growth” lie in the specificity of its institutionalized compromises.</p>
