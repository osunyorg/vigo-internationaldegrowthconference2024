  This Special Session discusses a current book project on growth imperatives and growth dependencies. The purpose of the anthology is to make this research field, which is still poorly established scientifically, more visible and to provide researchers and the interested public with an overview of the quite diverse approaches developed to date. In this session, we will first introduce the overall framing of the book. After that, four chapters of the book will be presented: 1) Two types of growth imperatives and their normative differences; 2) Employment and growth (in)dependence; 3) How does Japan tame social conflict without growth?; 4) Cultural time horizons of the pursuit of growth. The presentations will be followed by approx. 30 minutes of discussion.

        <p>The aim of the proposed Special Session is to discuss growth dependencies and imperatives, as covered in an edited book currently being written. The book is supposed to be published at the end of 2024 or the beginning of 2025. The purpose of the book is to make the academically still little established research field of growth imperatives and growth dependencies more visible and to provide an overview of the quite diverse approaches developed yet for researchers and the interested public. The book currently comprises seventeen contributions by nineteen authors from different disciplines, including economists, philosophers, and political scientists.</p><p>The book is structured into three parts. The first part deals with conceptions of growth as they developed in the history of ideas, became structurally embedded in society and consolidated into concrete ideals of progress. The second part deals with theories of growth imperatives and the controversial question of whether a capitalist economic system without growth inevitably slides into a severe economic crisis. The third part on growth dependencies explores the question of whether particular social sectors can maintain their respective standards of performance without growth. Under what conditions, for example, can the labor market keep employment constant without growth? And how, for example, can welfare state services continue to be financed at the same level without growth?</p><p>The proposed Special Session includes three contributions (90 minutes, no particular space requirements). At the beginning of the session, the editor will present the overall book project. In the following, three book chapters are presented by the authors. There will be an appr. 30 minutes discussion at the end on all presentations and growth imperatives and growth dependencies in general.</p><p><b>1)Two types of growth imperatives and their normative differences<br></b></p><p>Author(s): Tobias Vogel</p><p>I examine two types of possible growth imperatives to highlight their normative differences. First, I analyze labor-productive and capital-intensive technological progress. This technological progress not only pushes for growth to maintain jobs and finance rising capital costs, but also constitutes the systematic and permanent source of growth. Second, in accordance with insights from the debate about monetary growth imperatives, I analyze developments of rising income inequality insofar as they spark a process of mirror-image wealth and debt accumulation that burdens the economy with rising profit claims that may only be permanently serviceable through further growth. The latter type of growth imperative, unlike the former, is not based on an equivalent source of growth, but can at the same time have a growth-inhibiting effect.<br></p><p>Accordingly, I argue that the connection between sources of growth and imperatives for growth is normatively relevant because the political capacity to design growth processes is compromised if the economic system's capacity to grow does not keep pace with its need to grow. Under these conditions, economic policy operates under the restriction of avoiding imminent economic crises instead of using the enormous capacities of current economic systems primarily to tackle ecological and social problems. Furthermore, labor-productive and capital-intensive technological progress - despite all ambivalences - fits into the essential legitimacy conditions of social market economies, whereas rising wealth concentration conflicts with these legitimacy conditions.</p><p><b>2) Employment and growth (in)dependence<br></b></p><p>Author(s): Stefanie Gerold, Steffen Lange, Katharina Bohnenberger</p><p>In the public discourse, creating or maintaining jobs is one of the most prominent arguments why economic growth is needed. In fact, without growth unemployment rises because of labor productivity increases. This correlation between economic growth and employment, also known as Okun’s law, has repeatedly been observed, although the strength of this relationship is subject to great variety. In this contribution, we analyze how the growth dependence of employment can be overcome, or at least mitigated. We first argue that a post-growth transformation would itself diminish Okun’s law. This is because labor productivity growth often relies on increasing energy and material inputs. Redirecting technological change from labor productivity growth towards improving energy and resource productivity would lower labor productivity and thus growth pressures. In addition, we discuss a series of policies proposed in the post-growth literature to lessen the growth dependence of employment, including work sharing schemes, job guarantees, decreasing the cost of labor, and promoting jobs with low productivity (growth). Lastly, we explore policies that aim at decoupling employment from livelihoods, thus making individuals less dependent on wage income to meet their needs. These policies include universal basic income, universal basic services, as well as more self-sufficient lifestyles.<br></p><p><b>3) Regulation Theory and Japan: towards a new theorisation and application for the growth (in)dependence concept<br></b></p><p>Author(s): Riwan Driouich</p><p>The existing scientific literature on growth dependency/imperatives currently lacks a robust theoretical foundation and empirical applications, reflecting the relatively nascent state of this field within academia. This chapter explores relevant research avenues for addressing these deficiencies.<br></p><p>Primarily, I introduce a new theorisation of the concept of growth dependency through framing it within Regulation Theory (RT). An institutionalist school of thought rooted in Marxist economics, RT underscores the pivotal role of institutionalized compromises in shaping the dynamics of an economy. Institutionalized compromises are economic, social and political arrangements that regulate and mediate the relations between groups of economic agents with conflicting interests. RT pays attention to the mechanisms that enable such institutionalized compromises to reproduce themselves, id. est., to continue mediating conflicting interests between agents through time. Within this context, the concept of growth dependency is framed as an outcome of institutionalized compromises that necessitate sustained economic growth for their perpetuation.</p><p>Secondly, this conceptualization is applied to shed light on the (relative) resilience of contemporary Japan to a prolonged period of low growth. The country exhibits one of the lowest GDP per capita growth rates among OECD nations in the past three decades. Nonetheless, its socioeconomic system maintains relatively strong outcomes. Notably, the country features low rates of bankruptcy and unemployment, alongside a limited risk of fiscal crisis despite a high public debt-to-GDP ratio. I make sense of this resilience by attributing it to the intricate configuration of institutionalized compromises within the Japanese context.</p>
