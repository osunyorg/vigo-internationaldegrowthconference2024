    CSS127. Art and Science in Degrowth: A ManiQuesto
  summary: >-
    <p>What is the importance of the arts for degrowth? What are the points of tension, contradiction and possibility? In this special session we will collectively explore and generate new questions about the intersections between art and degrowth by creating a “ManiQuesto”. Inspired by the modernist Manifestos (Marx, Dada, Futurism, etc), the Maniquesto does not dictate what is, and is not, degrowth art. Instead, we will seek to provoke reflections and inspire conversations. We will raise paradoxes and concerns like how can you “curate” when “curation” is elitist?" Rather than being dogmatic, the Maniquesto questions can continually be reformulated and realigned as debates evolve. To kick off the debate, we will hear presentations from artist Dr. Laura Donkers (New Zealand) on ecological curation, artist Penelope Cain (Australia) on documenting lithium extraction, and dialogue with Adriaan Eeckels, leader of the Science-Art project conducted by the European Commission, on the “Naturarchy” project which invited artists and scientists “to re-imagine the western relation of human and non-human, in an attempt to ensure juridical persona to Nature’s many wonders, be they stardust or DNA.” Participants will be invited to sign “The Maniquesto” which will be published by the Degrowth Journal in an upcoming Special Issue on the arts.</p>
