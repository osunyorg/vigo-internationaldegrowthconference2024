summary: >
  This is a special session which presents the work of the “Sciart” project conducted at the European Commission’s Science and Knowledge service: the Joint Research Centre. Here artists, scientists and policymakers work together in transdisciplinary projects blending stardust and DNA, poetry with climate modelling, dance and law, post-normal science with Serresian poetics, semiotics and Quattrocento Florence. In this interactive session held with artists, scientists and policymakers we will dialogue together about the how, what and why of the project, and collectively examine how Sciart might be relevant to the objective of degrowth. We will watch artists' videos, play games, hear about topics such as agriculture, water contamination and forest fires, discuss and debate epistemological pluralism, imaginations of the future, the science-democracy gap, and slow science, as well as creative methodologies for responsible innovation, technological change, institutional barriers to creative practices and the governance of knowledge production and policymaking.

        <p>This is a special session which presents the work and results of a specific project “Sciart” conducted at the Joint Research Centre in Ispra, Italy. The JRC is the European Commission’s Science and Knowledge service and is comprised of six sites which provide evidence in support of EU policies. Ispra is the largest of these centres and home to the “Sciart Project”, established in 2016 and led by Adriaan Eeckels, as part of Unit “S”: “Innovation in Science and Policymaking”.</p><p>We propose a closed session with participation by invitation only which is primarily aligned with the track themes of "Imagining post-growth Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) futures", "Challenging dominant values, ideologies and imaginaries" and “Human Creativity and Innovation without Growth”. Our session is of relevance to participants interested in discussing and debating epistemological pluralism, post-normal science, the science-democracy gap, and slow science, as well as creative methodologies for responsible innovation, institutional barriers to creative practices and the governance of knowledge production and policymaking.<br></p><p>The session will be conducted in an interactive format. It is organised by a number of artists, scientists and policy makers working at the JRC, and Sofia Greaves, a researcher who completed her fieldwork there on 2023.<br></p><p>Our session will begin with an introductory ice breaker asking participants about their expectations and criticisms of scientific practice and innovation, to establish some ideas to work with throughout the time we are together. Building upon this material we will respond by adding our “diagnosis”: why the Sciart project was established and its given aims.<br></p><p>Artists will give short presentations to showcase the variety of approaches Sciart can take to explore policy problems in ways which go beyond the "status quo". These presentations will present material from the most recent of our Resonances Cycles, themed “Naturarchy: Towards a Natural Contract”, and the research questions this project seeks to address through transdisciplinary approaches. Our research project has invited artists, scientists and policymakers to collaboratively explore the problem that “We dominate and appropriate [nature]... Our fundamental relationship with objects comes down to war and property” (Michel Serres). We have asked participants how it might be possible to establish a more inclusive and equitable contract with our environment, thus a different relation with nature, which we deem a prime condition to acquire the necessary attitudes and skills to combat global warming. This has resulted in a number of projects which will be of interest to those engaged with postgrowth/degrowth debates, given the shared concerns with ecological economics, the environmental impacts of anthropocentrism and extraction, and feminist, more-than-human perspectives.  <br></p><p>“NaturArchy aims to explore – through artistic, scientific and legal expressions – how providing Nature and its phenomena with a contract that integrates her totally into our society can redefine our anthropocentric relationship with Nature. Intersecting science and law, reason and style, art and judgment, policy and imagination, NaturArchy wants to re-imagine the western relation of human and non-human, in an attempt to ensure juridical persona to Nature’s many wonders, be they stardust or DNA.”<br></p><p><b>Excerpt from the curatorial statement</b></p><p>After the presentations we will group participants around small tables with paper pens and material available to answer a few set questions about how these collaborations are relevant and aligned with degrowth. We hope to collectively establish the relevance of transdisciplinarity research and policy approaches to subjects of relevance to the participants' research topics and the degrowth movement. We anticipate this discussion to include agriculture, water contamination and more broadly, technologies.<br></p><p>We will next hold a collective debate which opens up dialogue between degrowth and artists, scientists and policymakers from a scientific institution. We hope to discuss what art-science has brought to the JRC and from there examine how it might be relevant to the objective of degrowth. For instance, through the articulation of new imaginaries; through the redefinition of the relationship between society, science, technology and innovation; by pushing forward ‘innovation’ over and above economic growth; by creating socially robust knowledge by bridging knowledge ecosystems.<br></p><p>We will end by re-working our expectations of science, as established in the icebreaker, to collectively invent improbable interdisciplinary sciences - such as Nonhuman Pedagogy or Dream Engineering: theory and praxis!</p>
