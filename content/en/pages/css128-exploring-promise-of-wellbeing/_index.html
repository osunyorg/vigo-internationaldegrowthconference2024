        <p>A wellbeing economy has been proposed and institutionally advanced in recent years as an alternative way of thinking about and organizing economies so that they would serve people and the planet, rather than the other way around. Wellbeing economies aim to deliver wellbeing and flourishing for all people within planetary boundaries. This can be done by restoring a more sustainable human-nature relationship, by ensuring a fair distribution of financial resources to address economic inequality, and by supporting human dignity and wellbeing within sustainability transformations. In practice, wellbeing economy actors promote actively engaged communities, businesses that are less oriented towards profit maximation, and preventive measures in social and health policies.  </p><p>In international policymaking, many prominent actors, such as OECD and WHO, have adopted the concept when endorsing policies that put people’s health and wellbeing at the heart of economic policymaking. Yet, the questions of ecological sustainability have gained less prominent status. Often, the concept of the wellbeing economy is used loosely by different actors without a shared understanding of its practical implications. In their recent study comparing the wellbeing economy narratives by Wellbeing Economy Alliance (WEAll) and Wellbeing Economy Governments (WEGos), Mason and Büchs (2023) found that WEAll explicitly demands that the dominance of GDP should be replaced by indicators on wellbeing and ecological sustainability. It also questions economic growth as the main political goal and challenges unsustainable characteristics of the current economic paradigm. WeGo actors, on the other hand, share less ambitious goals when they state that GDP should remain as the main indicator of wellbeing and could only be complemented with other alternative indicators. They don't consistently question the role of economic growth as an important policy goal. Instead of calling for system change, they are interested in fixing negative outcomes of the current economic system with incremental changes. Similarly, Hayden and Dasilva’s (2022) recent review of wellbeing economy initiatives concluded that they represent a “weak” rather than a “strong” postgrowth position.  <br></p><p>In this session, we elaborate on and critically review wellbeing economy initiatives from the postgrowth perspective. The questions that will be discussed will include the following: 1) How is the concept of wellbeing defined and framed in wellbeing economy discussion and how does this conceptualization align with the theories on sustainable wellbeing? 2) What is the relationship between wellbeing economy initiatives with economic growth and postgrowth initiatives, and how to advance wellbeing economies in the postgrowth context? 3) Who are the main actors in advancing the wellbeing economy in different countries and what kind of differences in power constellations can be found in the field?  <br></p><p>We aim to organize an interactive parallel session with presentations by invitation only. The session would bring together scholars, activists, and policymakers to discuss the relationship between wellbeing economy and postgrowth initiatives. The session is organized by two ongoing projects funded by the Horizon Europe: ‘Towards a sustainable wellbeing economy: Integrated policies and transformative indicators’ (ToBe) and ‘Measuring what matters: Improving usability and accessibility of policy frameworks and indicators for multidimensional well-being through collaboration (MERGE)’. The speakers in the session will include mainly members of these two consortia, such as,, for example, Eloi Laurent (Sciences Po), Aileen McLeod (European Policy Center), Robert Costanza (UCL), Lisa Hough-Stewart (WEAll), and some additional scholars (such as Richard Bärnthaler). The programme of the session would include short inputs from invited speakers and discussion hosted by the two chairs of this session.  </p>
