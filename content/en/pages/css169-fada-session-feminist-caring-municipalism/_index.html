  <p>Both climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have uncovered and reinforced overlapping crises of care in urban settings, especially as they concern socially vulnerable groups and their overlapping needs and identities (Amorim Maia et al. 2021; Manzanedo &amp; Manning, 2019). In response, caring cities, including places such as Vienna, Barcelona and Bremen in Europe, or Rosario and Valparaíso in Latin America have become global phenomena with their potential to transform societies and everyday politics along the ethics and practices of care. Often in connection to this, the municipalist movement, which is reshaping urban policy-making in cities around the world, is actively pushing for a feminization of urban politics and a re-centering of care in municipal spaces (Kussy et al., 2023, Bookchin, D., &amp; Colau, A. (2019). This special session will take these initiatives as examples for how care can be socialized in practice, aiming to co-learn from municipalist governments in Barcelona, Madrid, etc. as well as from other municipal strategies for commonizing care work.  </p>

        <p>This session will be organized as a knowledge exchange among practitioners and researchers, and therefore have a slightly more open and flexible format than the conventional parallel session. The session will last for 90 minutes, and have a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 50 participants. Ideally, it would be held in a space that facilitates dialogue, for example, where chairs can be re-arranged in a circle instead of in rows with a frontal speaker, or where people can break up in smaller groups and have discussions. </p><p>After a short input from a leading researcher in the field of caring cities and/or feminist municipalism, the session will feature a number of shorter inputs from practitioners in the field from a variety of cities and initiatives, followed by a facilitated knowledge exchange and discussion. Hence, these sessions foster transnational dialogue and movement-learning.</p><p>How this session will contribute to degrowth: The municipal scale has been identified as a potential and promising entry point for the institutionalization of post-growth politics (Schmid, 2023). This is especially in the light of a gap between the envisioned institutionalization of post-growth and care-related practices, and the already occurring and well-researched prefigurative initiatives in communities, centering these practices. Caring cities and care municipalism have the potential to reshape municipal and everyday politics, as well as urban spatial dynamics around care. This special session aims to further the dialogue on these issues and produce strategic insights, which will contribute to advancing the feminist degrowth debate on commonizing the means of care. Moreover, it will deepen the links between degrowth and municipalism, which has been deemed crucial for mediating community-led experiments and systemic transformations into postgrowth, caring futures.</p>
