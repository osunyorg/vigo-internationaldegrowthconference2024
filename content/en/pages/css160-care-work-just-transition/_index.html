    CSS160. Care work in the just transition
  summary: >-
    <p>Intellectual and political efforts to integrate labour within ecological and degrowth transitions have multiplied in recent years. However, they have paid scant attention to typically feminised and undervalued labour sectors, namely, to care work. Based on the work developed by the Just Transition and Care network over the past two years, this special session will discuss a policy brief on Care work in the Just Transition through interventions from non-academic representatives in five distinct sectors of care work (domestic and community care; peasant food production; healthcare; earthcare; and education), in conversation with a representative from the International Labour organization and/or International Trade Unions Confederation.</p>

The framework indicates how to compensate for the necessary phasing-out of carbon-intensive industries while also responding to the most urgent and vital needs of frontline communities, by creating decent, stable and community-driven jobs in clean energy and infrastructures.  Intellectual and political efforts to integrate labour within ecological and degrowth transitions have multiplied in recent years. However, feminised and undervalued labour sectors, namely, care work, has received scant attention among these analyses. The Covid19 pandemic, however, has called attention towards the many forms of care work (paid and unpaid) that are needed to re/produce healthy bodies, societies and ecosystems, and that go either unrecognized, or seriously under-valued and undermined in most countries. Yet, a full recognition of the relevance of care work to the JT agenda is still largely missing. Recognizing these sectors, and the way in which labour and environmental issues intersect within them, can help understand the complexities around just transitions to degrowth in the Global North and South. The Just Transition and Care (JTC) network addresses this gap by exploring the place of care work in the politics of Just Transition.  The JTC is a joint initiative of the Inter-University Research Centre for Atlantic Landscapes and Cultures (CISPAC) at the University of Santiago de Compostela in collaboration with the Center for Environmental Justice of Colorado State University and the UNRISD’s Just Transition Research Collaborative. It aims at establishing an international network of researchers and stakeholders with a shared interest in discussing the relevance of both social and environmental care work to the politics of just transition. Seeing the Just Transition agenda as a crucial platform for demanding socially just climate and environmental policies, the Just Transition and Care (JTC) initiative aims to facilitate an international conversation around the relevance of both social and environmental care work to the politics of just transition. The JTC has developed interactions between academic researchers and stakeholders (including care workers, union representatives, activists, and community-economy actors) over the course of five webinars taking place between June 2021 and April 2023.  Each webinar has addresses a different aspect of the nexus between ecological transitions and care work through the experiences and perspectives of  workers, trade unionists and activists in five distinct sectors of care work (domestic and community care; peasant food production; healthcare; earthcare; and education), with academics playing the role of facilitators and active listeners. Based on the work developed by the Just Transition and Care network over the past two years, this special session will discuss the place of care work in just transitions to Degrowth. It will do so through five interventions by workers, trade unionists and activists from the Global North and South, in conversation with a representative from the International Labour organization and/or International Trade Unions Confederation. Interventions will address the following issues: the connections between Just Transition to Degrowth and the aforementioned care work sectors; and the political implications of such connections for current and future activism/policy-making around Just Transitions to Degrowth. Presenters  <br>  <br> Baba Aye  (Public Service International (PSI))  <br>  <br> Selma James  (Global Women's Strike)  <br>  <br> María Ferreiro  (Sindicato Labrego Galego)  <br>  <br> Natalia de la Vega  (Sindicato Profesional de Bomberos Forestales (FIRET))  <br>  <br> Alanah Torralba  (Education International)  <br> </p>
