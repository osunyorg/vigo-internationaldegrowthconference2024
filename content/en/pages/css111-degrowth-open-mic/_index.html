summary: >-
  When thinking about a degrowth future, does it feel like the words that come to your mind are rebellious and can’t be tamed in a well thought-through book, or a referenced paper?<br>Join this Degrowth Open Mic to speak, sing, declaim, play, rap, hmm, improvise, tell jokes, or act. And to listen, vibe, receive and share emotions. All audible formats are welcome, as long as they allow you to express your relation to Degrowth and your vision of a Degrowth future.<br>Original creations preferred but not mandatory. Instruments, props, collaborations etc welcome. Each performance will be limited to 5 minutes to ensure a diversity of voices are heard. To make the session more inclusive, you may choose to prepare a script of your input and print it out. Please remember there will be a diverse audience. No form of hate speech or inappropriate behaviour or language will be tolerated.

        <p>This session will an open space where creativity is unrestrained and encouraged. This will contribute to Degrowth in several ways. First, fiction and arts are essential to develop post-growth imaginaries. Unleashing the participants’ imagination will enable them to imagine and communicate Degrowth utopias, which may be harder to express in more academic formats. Then, arts and creativity are known to have a positive impact on wellbeing. Moreover, the session will be a relaxed and convivial moment, thus putting values central to Degrowthat its foreground. Finally, artists will be key actors in a Degrowth future, for they offer a form of culture and entertainment that can be simple, local and resource-light, and can contribute to strengthening social ties. The session will thus both envision post-growth futures through the content of the participants’ performances, and enact Degrowth.</p><p><b>Dynamic proposed:</b><br></p><p>Participants will come as audience members, and some will also decide to be performers. Importantly, no registration will be required so as to allow participants to spontaneously switch from “audience” to “performer”.</p><p>Two compères/MCs will present the goal of the session and its format in an engaging and entertaining way. They will break the ice, encourage participants to go on stage, and ensure smooth transitions between performers.</p><p>Participants may have prepared an input or may improvise. Each performer will be given 5 minutes maximum. Once all performers have been on stage and if time allows it, performers will be given the chance to perform a second time.</p><p><b>Technicalities:</b></p><p> The audience would be able to either sit at the front or stand at the back and on the sides. There would be a stage space that would not necessarily need to be higher than the audience (a clear outline would suffice). There will be microphones and an amplifier and, if possible, some musical instruments.</p><p>There won't be an upper limit of participants to allow as many participants as possible to attend.<br></p>
