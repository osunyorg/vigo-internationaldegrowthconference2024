  summary: >-
    <p>“Investing in degrowth” sounds like a contradiction, but experimenting with this idea in theory and practice is critical to developing degrowth as a viable option. This session will elucidate how so-called “sustainable finance” can move beyond its current horizon of impact investing. In shifting from extractive and concentrative forms of financialised capitalism towards models that can more equitably distribute both resources and power, post-growth finance dissolves growth imperatives while catalysing the transitions we need.</p>
