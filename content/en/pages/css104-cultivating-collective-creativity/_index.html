    CSS104. Cultivating collective creativity through Indigenous ways of knowing
  summary: >-
    <p>Guided group evaluation of flush toilet technology and a vermi-composting alternative. Flush toilets have proliferated throughout the developed world as a symbol of progress but have allowed greater concentrations of people to live in closer proximity. A problem that has eventuated is that the increased population density has created detrimental concentrated impacts on the water bodies these systems discharge into. The evaluation will adopt a Māori epistemology for sharing knowledge. The goal of this epistemology is ensuring the flourishing of ecosystems. For flourishing to occur, the life supporting capacity of ecosystems (mauri) must be enhanced and understood from the perspective of intrinsic belonging. The deep understanding embodied in mauri is now being relied upon in New Zealand to inform relationships to water, to reform past policy and laws, to respond to challenges such as climate change and natural disasters, and to identify a more sustainable future.</p>

Our approach will be to facilitate an evaluation of conventional flush technology versus a vermi-composting alternative that is more strongly aligned to Māori values. The evaluation will be carried out by the participants in the session working in four groups initially, as a whole collective and then individually on Slido or Kahoot to reflect on the inclusion of cultural bias (while we prepare the results presentation), and ending in a collective discussion of the results and the process. The Scenario:  Flush toilets have proliferated throughout the developed world as a symbol of progress and have allowed greater concentrations of people to live in closer proximity. A problem that has eventuated is that the increased population density has created more concentrated impacts on the water bodies that the wastewater collection systems discharge into. Aging of this infrastructure has reduced their efficiency, and communities are at a juncture in terms of continuing with the existing approach and its technological limitations or innovating alternative approaches that could provide better aligned solutions that are less impactful on their ecosystems and dependent populations. Introduction formalities  - facilitation team welcome, description of process, and topic overview  <br> Activity 1: Brainstorm mauri dimension indicators from master list in four groups. Each group produce an indicator list for one dimension with two to four selected indicators in order of importance.  <br> Activity 2: The mauri0meter approach to measurement is shared. Each group identify possible upper and lower thresholds of impact significance, reflected by changes in; behaviour, effort, risk, outcome, health and safety, ecosystem resilience, community resilience, family resilience, or economic wealth.    <br> Activity 3: Groups score their dimension indicators using the mauri0meter and smartphone Slido App for the two options of flush technology and alternative decentralised vermi-composting.  <br> Activity 4: Worldview bias survey completed individually on Slido App.  <br> Results:  Facilitation team share results for each dimension analysis and 50-year cumulative impact. Demonstrate what happens when worldview bias is included (spread of bias and impact on live SS). Discussion:   <br> How has the evaluation influenced your understanding of flush toilet technology?  <br> How would you share your understanding of cumulative impacts of flush toilets?  <br> How important is worldview bias, and quantifying its influence, for your understanding?  <br> What was good about the process used?  <br> What was not helpful about the process used?  <br> Close session  – next steps and thanks given to session participants <br>Session schedule:  <br> Introduction: 10 minutes  <br> Activity 1: 12 minutes  <br> Activity 2: 20 minutes  <br> Activity 3: 10 minutes  <br> Activity 4: 10 minutes  <br> Results: 20 minutes  <br> Discussion: 6 minutes  <br> Close: 2 minutes  <br> Following the workshop, each participant will be sent the indicators, thresholds and scoring analysis for their dimension and the overall results presented back in a summary report.</p>
