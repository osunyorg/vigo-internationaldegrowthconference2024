Started in 1972 as International Wages for Housework campaign, since 2020 the movement has actively contributed to shape the Care Income policy proposal, and started a number of related campaigns, also in collaboration with Extinction Rebellion UK. In 2021, Global Women’s Strike supported the massive year-long farmers’ & farmworkers’ protest against the three farm laws aimed at handing over agriculture to corporations. In the process, they established a partnership with a remarkable women’s movement organized in Self-Help Groups which was leading a transformation to Natural Farming in the State of Andhra Pradesh. As stated in the GWS’s website:As mothers, carers, farmers/farm workers, land and human rights’ defenders, women do most of the work of feeding (starting with breastfeeding) and protecting families and communities, the soil and the environment. For doing this fundamental caring work of society, unwaged and low-waged, we are impoverished and denied basic rights, including to the land we work. Organising in self-help groups, women in Andhra Pradesh, India, are leading a massive community movement of natural farmers who regenerate the soil to grow healthy food and stop climate change. Scaling up internationally is crucial. A care income for all natural farmers would empower such movements, encourage all genders to contribute and to refuse work that pollutes. The subsidies now paid to poison soil, water and air, must be redirected to caring for people and the planet, starting in the Global South and working-class communities everywhere, especially Indigenous and other people of colour, who are hardest hit by the climate emergency.SESSION CSS143 - I: Introducing the Care Income: from the Green New Deal for Europe to the Global Women’s Strike. <br>Speaker 1:  Stefania Barca (University of Santiago de C.), “The Care Income from a feminist degrowth perspective – a persona appraisal”</p>  <p>Speaker 2: Selma James (Global Women’s Strike), “From Wages for Housework to a Care Income for People and Planet: ﬁfty years of sex-race-and-class struggles”  <br>Speaker 3: Nina López (Global Women’s Strike), “Care Income campaigns around the world: victories, challenges, and alliance building”  <br>Speaker 4 (discussant): Bibiana Martínez Álvarez, USC <br>Chair: Gea Piccardi, Center for Social Studies, Coimbra <br>SESSION CSS143 - II: Caring for the land and for ourselves: women’s leadership in peasant farming and agroecology <br>Speaker 1: Swati Renduchintala (Andhra Pradesh Community Managed Natural Farming) <br>Speaker 2: Isabel Vilalba and María Ferreiro (Sindicato Labrego Galego, Secretaria da Muller) <br>Chairs: Nina López (Global Women’s Strike) and Bibiana Martínez Álvarez (USC)</p>
