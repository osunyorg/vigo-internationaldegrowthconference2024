  Citizen science is a fundamental tool to promote a post-growth era, enabling 1) the democratisation of scientific knowledge, 2) detection of unnoticed problems, 3) legitimisation of necessary change, and 4) policy influence. This special session will explain the Postgrowth SA: Pontevedra project, a year-long citizen science initiative in Pontevedra involving high school students. They investigated achieving a just ecological transition in the city through four case studies: water pollution, mental health and green spaces, loss of rural lifestyles, and employment. The replicable and scalable methodology used will be detailed, highlighting key findings, strengths, and lessons learnt for future citizen science processes.

        <p>The transition of the current economic, social, and political models requires unlimited economic growth in order to continue to function normally and ensure the stability of the system. Unfortunately, economic growth has significant environmental (e. g., climate change) and social impacts (e. g., increasing inequalities and social injustice), so the idea of economic growth as a social engine must be abandoned. In this context, post-growth calls for a transition to new economic, social, and political models in which the social engine is the flourishing and reproduction of human life itself within ecological limits.</p><p>To drive the transition, it is necessary to go beyond the readjustment of current economic, social, and political models and develop viable and sustainable long-term alternatives. This requires, among other things, the democratic participation of citizens in all dimensions of collective life, including the generation of knowledge. From a social science perspective, citizen participation in knowledge creation is crucial to capture different values, visions, and perspectives of reality in order to develop collective solutions based on calm and rationality. In this special session, we present the Postgrowth SA: Pontevedra project, a year-long citizen science initiative in Pontevedra involving high school students. For one year, the students participated in 1) challenge identification, 2) research design, 3) fieldwork, 4) data analysis and 5) knowledge transfer. The project represents a unique experience and the methodology used is designed to be replicable and scalable.</p><p>In this special session, we will present the results of the project. Firstly, <b>Brais Suárez Eiroa</b> will introduce the project, structure the general process of citizen science, and set the stage for the rest of the session's presentations. Then, <b>Aitor Alonso Rodríguez</b> will present the main conceptual results of the project. His presentation will address the results of the case studies and the overarching findings. Thirdly, <b>Jose Vázquez Carpintero</b>, a teacher at IES Frei Martín Sarmiento, will present his perspective as a teacher of the project and of this type of project for young people in general. Fourthly, <b>Melanie Veiga Pazos</b>, a student from IES Luis Seoane, will give her perspective as a student of the project and, in general, of this type of project for young people. Finally, <b>Ana García Quintana</b> will close the lecture cycle by presenting the main lessons learnt from the citizen science process, the main limitations of the methodology used and reflecting on possible improvements for the replicability of the project in other places in the future.</p><p>  </p><p>The session will last for 90 minutes, and each presentation will be maximum 10 minutes, which leaves around 30-40 minutes for a joint discussion and Q&amp;A at the end.</p>
