    CSS102. Changing the world with(out) taking state power?
  summary: >-
    <p>This workshop proposes an interactive session on the possibilities and pitfalls of seizing state power. Whilst the role of grassroots social movements is idealised, the majority of degrowth proposals prioritise state intervention (Cosme et al., 2017). A conclusion confirmed by a recent survey of the degrowth movement where an overwhelming majority agrees that “solving social and environmental issues requires taking state power” (Fitzpatrick et al., forthcoming). Taking concepts like states and markets for granted is inherited by ecological economists who often rely on reductionist reasoning to justify the existence of states and ignore the movements anarchist roots (e.g., D’Alisa & Kallis, 2020). This comes despite nuanced internal (Alexander & Gleeson, 2020) and external (Baker, 2019, 2023) critiques of seizing state power. In short, the degrowth movement sidelines the critique of seizing state power without having strategies for how to seize it. The question remains: can we change the world with(out) taking state power?</p>
