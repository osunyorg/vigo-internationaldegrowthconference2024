summary: >
  This workshop proposes an interactive session on the possibilities and pitfalls of seizing state power. Whilst the role of grassroots social movements is idealised, the majority of degrowth proposals prioritise state intervention (Cosme et al., 2017). A conclusion confirmed by a recent survey of the degrowth movement where an overwhelming majority agrees that “solving social and environmental issues requires taking state power” (Fitzpatrick et al., forthcoming). Taking concepts like states and markets for granted is inherited by ecological economists who often rely on reductionist reasoning to justify the existence of states and ignore the movements anarchist roots (e. g., D’Alisa &amp; Kallis, 2020). This comes despite nuanced internal (Alexander &amp; Gleeson, 2020) and external (Baker, 2019,2023) critiques of seizing state power. In short, the degrowth movement sidelines the critique of seizing state power without having strategies for how to seize it. The question remains: can we change the world with(out) taking state power?

        <p>This workshop “Changing the world with(out) taking state power?” provides space for critical reflection on the role of seizing state power to achieve degrowth. In a world where most governments are moving in the opposite direction and actively cracking down on those who resist it, this workshop will investigate if the state is a friend or foe of degrowth. This 90-min workshop is structured as follows:</p><p><b>1. Welcome and introduction</b> (10 minutes)<br></p><ul>  <li>5 minutes for introductions and/or latecomers </li>  <li>5 minutes outlining workshop structure, goals, and activities</li>  </ul><p><b>2. Presentation by organisers</b> (15 minutes)</p><ul>  <li>5 minutes for summarising the main social theories behind the degrowth movement (e. g., reformism, ecosocialism, ecomarxism, ecofeminism, ecoanarchism)</li>  <li>5 minutes for zooming into degrowth and the state (e. g., D’Alisa &amp; Kallis, 2020; Koch, 2022), especially how they ignore anarchist critiques of seizing state power</li>  <li>5 minutes for outlining the guiding questions (e. g. What is the state? Is the state a tool of class domination? Is domination a means to achieve degrowth? Is the state necessary or desirable to achieve degrowth? If yes, when/how should degrowth state power? (e. g., transition, always), If not, what means are needed to achieve degrowth?)</li>  </ul><p><b>3. Breakout discussions</b> (55 minutes)</p><ul><li>Divide participants into groups of 4-5 to discuss the above questions on the state</li></ul><p><b>4. Reflection round</b> (10 minutes)<br></p><ul><li>Each group will summarise their key takeaways </li></ul><p><b>Remarks on this contribution</b>This session will build on a previous session at the Degrowth Zagreb conference by Nick Fitzpatrick and Xavier Gabet entitled, "How should degrowth approach power". During this workshop, participants discussed the seven points of power contestation and their implications for research on social change: over-vs-to, centred-vs-diffused, consensual-vs-conflictual, constraining-vs-enabling, quantity-vs-quality, empowerment-vs-disempowerment, and power-vs-knowledge (based on Avelino, 2021). Given the strong attendance (n=45) and positive feedback from the workshop, especially around the issue of state power, this Special Session would be a follow up workshop from Zagreb.<br></p>
