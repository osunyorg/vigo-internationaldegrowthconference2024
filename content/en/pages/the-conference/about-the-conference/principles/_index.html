        <p>The conference is organized in alignment with the core values and principles of both degrowth and ecological economics. The host organization, Post-Growth Innovation Lab, and the conference’s Organizing Committee also uphold these values and principles. We delve into these further below:</p><p><b>Cooperation</b>: We foster collaboration with local and international individuals and collectives, spanning from local government to international activist groups.</p><p><b>Involvement of civil society</b>: The conference seeks to engage various local actors. We will host a number of events that provide opportunities for the  local and scientific community to come together.  Recognizing that scientific knowledge can sometimes be perceived as inaccessible to the public,  this event strives to promote and enable new avenues for knowledge exchange (in both directions). </p><p><b>Sustainability</b>: We prioritize minimizing environmental and social impact throughout the preparation and execution of the conference. This includes considerations such as sustainable catering choices, venue selection, and partnering with suppliers who share our commitment to sustainability.</p><p><b>Solidarity</b>: We promote solidarity among conference participants through a "solidarity fee". This optional higher registration fee is suggested to more established participants, with the proceeds supporting the participation of students and academic staff from less privileged backgrounds.</p><p><b>Inclusivity</b>: The event aims to be as inclusive as possible by providing step-free access for people with mobility needs. Sign-language interpreters will be available upon request. Additionally, we will accommodate a range of dietary requirements and preferences, such as lactose and gluten intolerance, as well as allergies.</p><p><b>Equality</b>: Ensuring equality in terms of gender, race, and LGBTQ+ representation is of utmost importance in the organization of this conference. All conference committees and organizing bodies strive to achieve gender equality and maintain spaces for open expression. The conference will emphasize the use of inclusive language in official communications and during the event itself.</p>
