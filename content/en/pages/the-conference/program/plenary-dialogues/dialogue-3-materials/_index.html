  summary: >-
    <p>Wednesday 19 June 2024, 11.00h (Plenary tent) with Ekaterina Chertkovskaya (Lund University) & Alice Mah (University of Glasgow), moderated by Vincenzo Pavone (CSIC)  In this plenary, Ekaterina Chertkovskaya and Alice Mah will lead us into the politics of materials and the plastic industry. The dialogue will address the emerging problems of plastic and similarly aggressive materials, as well as the technologies and policies that have been so far implemented to address them. The session will conclude with a hopeful review of alternatives available, especially from the anticapitalist/degrowth perspectives. </p>
