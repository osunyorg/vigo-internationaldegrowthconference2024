  Tuesday 18 June 2024 (Pazo da Cultura)
  
  
  
  Degrowth, ecological economics, post-development. Concepts that relate to each other, overlap in terms of social goals, engagement and in many other perspectives. But how? And what are the differences? What is the story and the history behind them? Brototi Roy, Joshua Farley and Giorgos Kallis try to do the impossible and debate these questions in an hour at the opening plenary dialogue that is also going to be a live recording of an Economics for Rebels podcast. Hosted by Alexandra Köves.
