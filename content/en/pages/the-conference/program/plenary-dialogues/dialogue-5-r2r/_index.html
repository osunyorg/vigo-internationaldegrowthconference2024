  <p>Thursday 20 June 2024, 15.00h (Plenary tent) with Ugo Vallauri (Co-Founder and Co-Director of The Restart Project) &amp; Blanca Callén (Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona), moderated by Javier Lloveras (Universidade de Vigo)  The promotion of repair and maintenance practices is central to both degrowth and ecological economics. In recent years, the right to repair is emerging as a powerful movement against restrictive repair policies and the barriers that big manufacturers impose on fixing our devices. In this plenary dialogue, you will join our esteemed speakers Ugo Vallauri and Blanca Caillén as they explore how the right to repair movement can become a catalyst for dismantling the culture of consumerism, combating planned obsolescence, and reclaiming our ability to repair and reuse technology.</p>
