        <p>First, papers that do not comply with BSP formal application criteria will be excluded. Grades used in all evaluation steps are 1,2, 3,4 (poor, adequate, good, very good). </p><p>Preselection of the submissions will be based on at least four reviews (including the ones used for admission to the conference) of the short and extended abstracts. Missing reviews are assigned by the chair or his/her delegates. </p><p>The pre-selection criteria are "relevance to ecological economics" and "academic rigour/clarity and flair of writing." The score in each criterion is calculated as the arithmetic average of the grades of the reviews. The rank will be generated as follows.</p><ul>  <li> First, submissions for relevance to ecological economics lower than 2.3 will be excluded. </li>  <li>Then, submissions will be ranked according to the score in the academic quality/clarity and flair of writing.</li>  </ul><p>Each of the selected manuscripts is assigned by the chair to three jury members for review, who independently rates it using the above-indicated grades and the following criteria: </p><ol>  <li>Academic rigour</li>  <li>Clarity and flair of writing</li>  <li>Originality</li>  <li>Potential impact</li>  </ol><p>Criteria are in order of importance, and weights of 40 %, 25 %, 20 %, 15 % are used to aggregate them via geometric mean. <br></p><p>The first six manuscripts will be orally presented in a conference session (9 minutes each + 6 minutes Q&amp;A). Authors ranking from 7th to 10th will be admitted to the presentation in case someone of the first six withdraws. </p><p>The jury members will attend the presentations and privately assign an individual score that is handed in a closed envelope to the jury chair. Presentations can also be used to verify the contribution of the applicant in case there are multiple authors and questions around the applicant's contribution. </p><p>Then, the BSP jury finalises and selects the three prizes at a meeting in person on the same day. First, the envelopes with the members' grades of the presentations are open, and the grades are averaged to get the presentation score for each candidate; then the final ranking is obtained based on the weighted arithmetic mean of the score earned by the paper (70 %) and by the presentation (30 %). In case of a motivated opposition to the final ranking by 30 % of the jury members, the prizes will be awarded by majority vote.</p>
