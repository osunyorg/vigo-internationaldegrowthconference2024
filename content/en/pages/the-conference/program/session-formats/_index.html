    <p>Type of sessions  <br>   <br>The Conference will count on two types of sessions:   <br> Parallel sessions : Will be organized in 90 minutes slots, having 1-3 slots each conference day. During each time slot there will be at least 10 parallel sessions which will be held in separate spaces. The Open and closed sessions approved as a result of the Call for Special Sessions will be held within these slots.  <br> Plenary sessions : There will be 1-3 plenary sessions each day. These sessions will have a length of around 1 hour, and will be organized as dialogues between 2 or more keynote speakers, who will be relevant and recognized people in the field of degrowth and ecological economics. Some of these activities will be part of the opening and closing ceremonies.</p>  <p> Contributions formats  <br>   <br> Conventional panel contributions : Oral  classical  contributions.   <br> Interactive contributions : Contributions that depart from the traditional panel format. These might include book discussions, screenings, performances, walking tours, brainstorming sessions, writing workshops, or whatever else might inspire you.  <br> Artistic contributions : Practice-based reflections and art works which engage with the goals and messages of degrowth and ecological economics. Creatives including (but not limited to) artists, filmmakers, literary writers, theatre and performance-makers, designers, musicians, street artists, socially-engaged practitioners, collectives, and curators are invited to share and reflect upon their work. Your practice might respond, for example, to subjects such as the personhood of nature, care, hope, interdependence, more than human perspectives, energy, contamination, or waste. We also invite submissions of artworks which will be considered for live and/or virtual exhibition and/or performance during the conference.  <br> Posters : Poster sessions will have the same importance as all the other sessions. Moreover, the works accepted under this modality will achieve greater visibility as they will be on public display uninterruptedly for the duration of the event, and a digital version of each poster will be permanently displayed on the conference website. The poster modality will have a slot during several of the conference days, in which the authors will have the opportunity to explain their work and answer questions from the audience.  Since thinking outside of conventional boundaries is an important theme for this conference, we encourage participants to be creative in preparing the posters, without leaving aside rigor. Aim to explain the work effectively and dynamically to capture public imaginations.</p>
