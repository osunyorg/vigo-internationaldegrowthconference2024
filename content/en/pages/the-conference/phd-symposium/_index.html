        <p>There will be three interactive sessions with skill-shares on grant writing and ‘how to survive academia’ that speak on care and collaboration; tips on publishing critical research; and non-academic communication and arts. All are designed to support those whose research questions mainstream discourses, such as the growth imperative with degrowth, and support doctoral students’ transition to the next step in their careers. Participation is free, but applying and registration is mandatory since the number of places is limited to 30 students.</p><p>The submission deadline is the 31st of March. We will communicate the acceptance status to applicants by the 5th of April. </p><p><b>Organisers</b>: <a href="https://postgrowth-lab.uvigo.es/people/alejandro-fortuny/" target="_blank">Alejandro Fortuny<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>, <a href="https://postgrowth-lab.uvigo.es/people/josephine-becker/" target="_blank">Josephine Becker<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>, <a href="https://postgrowth-lab.uvigo.es/people/noortje-keurhorst/" target="_blank">Noortje Keurhorst<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> and <a href="https://postgrowth-lab.uvigo.es/people/victor-jose-sanchez/" target="_blank">Víctor Sánchez<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> (Post-Growth Innovation Lab)</p><p><b>For whom</b>: Doctoral scholars (ideally 2<sup>nd</sup> year onwards and attending the ESEE-Degrowth International Conference 2024) </p><p><b>Location</b>: University of Vigo, Escola de Enxeñería Forestal - Aula 1 (Campus of Pontevedra), Pontevedra, Spain</p><p><b>Date and time</b>: June 17, 2024.

        <p><b>1) Critical research and publishing with </b><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander-Dunlap" target="_blank"><b>Dr Alexander Dunlap</b><span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a><b> <br></b>Beyond the formalities of academic journals, there are generally various ‘unspoken’ expectations and requirements for the successful publishing of research, especially difficult for those engaging in critical research. Therefore, this session will focus on advancing publishing skills for such research. This session will be held by Dr Alexander Dunlap who is a social anthropologist working in the field of political ecology, extractivist development, and low-carbon technologies. He is a co-editor at <i>Human Geography</i> and serves on various editorial boards such as the <i>Journal of Political Ecology &amp; Globalizations</i>. </p><p><b>2) Arts-based research and methods with </b><a href="https://postgrowth-lab.webs.uvigo.es/people/sofia-greaves/" target="_blank"><b>Dr Sofia Greaves</b><span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a><b> <br></b>In this session, we will explore arts-based research as a methodology for degrowth. Going past the common framing of art as a means to communicate scientific facts, we engage with art as a methodology for knowledge creation. We will talk about why arts-based research is important for degrowth in addition to exploring how it can be applied to participants’ respective areas of research. Collectively, we will experience arts-based methods in practice and make artistic expressions to take away.  </p><p><b>3) Surviving academia with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susana-fernandez-lopez?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eqwant%2Ecom%2F&amp;originalSubdomain=es" target="_blank">Susana Fernández<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a> and </b><a href="https://brototiroy.com/" target="_blank"><b>Dr Brototi Roy</b><span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a><b><br></b>This session is split into two parts. For the first part, we will have a workshop facilitated by Susana Fernandez Lopez on how to cultivate a profile for postdoctoral funding and how to write a postdoctoral proposal. For the second part, on how to survive academia as a critical scholar, we will count on Dr. Brototi Roy, an ecological economist working on material footprints of the energy transition from a perspective rooted in political ecology. She will share with us her experience as a radical scholar.</p>
