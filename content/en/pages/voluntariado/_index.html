        <p>Between 17 and 21 June 2024, the <b>ESEE-Growth 2024 International Conference</b> will take place in the city of Pontevedra, an important event that will jointly host the <i>10th International Degrowth Conference</i> and the <i>15th Conference of the European Society for Ecological Economics</i> (ESEE). Under the title <i><b>Science, Technology, and Innovation beyond growth: Cultivating collective creativity for a sustainable future</b></i>, this event will be one of the most important events of the year at the University of Vigo, as it will bring together leading international experts in the field of degrowth and ecological economics to debate on highly relevant and topical issues such as energy, welfare, technology, political ecology, feminism, social justice, and many others.</p><p>In addition to the academic activities, the Conference will have a full agenda of <b>extra-academic activities</b> open to the public, including talks, round tables, workshops, and concerts, with the participation of communicators, writers, artists, activists, publishers...</p><p>The organisation of this event is being coordinated by the <a href="https://postgrowth-lab.webs.uvigo.es/" target="_blank"><b>Post-Growth Innovation Lab</b></a>, a research group of the University of Vigo directed by the researcher Mario Pansera. Although the whole group is involved in the organisation of this event, for everything to go perfectly, we will need more people during the days of the conference who can support the organising team in different tasks. For this reason, we are creating a volunteer group in which we would like to count on people like youÂ ðŸ˜‰.</p>

        <p>The most important is that it will <b>allow them to participate for free in an international scientific event</b> and to do so in an active and totally immersive way, by being part of the organisation of the event. But, in addition, they will have the following advantages:</p><ul> <li>When they are not performing the tasks assigned to them, volunteersÂ <b>will be able to access all the activities of the Conference free of charge</b>, without having to pay any registration fee.<br> </li> <li>At the end of the event, they <b>will receive a document accrediting their participation in the Local Organising Committee </b>of the conference (this type of merit is useful in public calls for human resources and is highly valued when it comes to accessing certain jobs).</li> <li>They will also receive a <b>certificate of attendance at the Conference</b>, similar to what the other participants will receive.</li> <li> <b>1.3 ECTS for University of Vigo students</b> who participate in the event, both as paying attendees and as part of the volunteer team.</li> <li>They will have <b>free access to the official meals of the Conference</b> during those days.</li> <li>They will receive a <b>t-shirt with an exclusive design created for the conference</b>, which they will wear while doing volunteer work and keep as a souvenir at the end of the event.</li> <li>They will be able to <b>meet new people and be part of an international team</b>.</li> </ul>

        <p>Anyone of legal age can apply to join the team of volunteers. It is important, however, that <b>those who apply are willing to make the commitment and fulfill the tasksÂ </b><b>assignedÂ </b>by the Conference organising team.</p><p>Participation in this activity will be a <b>great experience for the volunteers </b>and, as indicated in the previous section, the organisers will try to adapt the tasks and schedules to the needs and conditions of each volunteer, and to ensure that they can also enjoy the Conference activities as assistants, limiting the time spent working at the event. But for this to happen, <b>it is necessary that the people who form part of the volunteer team do so responsibly</b> and that, if they offer to participate, they are honest with their commitment.<br></p><p>To apply to become a volunteer for the ESEE-Growth 2024 International Conference, please <b>fill in <a href="https://forms.office.com/e/V8F3AXBV7P" target="_blank">this form</a> before 31 May 2024</b>.<br></p><p>If you have any questions, please contact us at <b>comm_esee-degrowth2024@uvigo.gal</b>.<br></p>
