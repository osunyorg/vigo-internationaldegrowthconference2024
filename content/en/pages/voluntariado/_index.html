    <p>  <br>Between 17 and 21 June 2024, the  ESEE-Growth 2024 International Conference  will take place in the city of Pontevedra, an important event that will jointly host the  10th International Degrowth Conference  and the  15th Conference of the European Society for Ecological Economics  (ESEE). Under the title  Science, Technology, and Innovation beyond growth: Cultivating collective creativity for a sustainable future , this event will be one of the most important events of the year at the University of Vigo, as it will bring together leading international experts in the field of degrowth and ecological economics to debate on highly relevant and topical issues such as energy, welfare, technology, political ecology, feminism, social justice, and many others. In addition to the academic activities, the Conference will have a full agenda of  extra-academic activities  open to the public, including talks, round tables, workshops, and concerts, with the participation of communicators, writers, artists, activists, publishers... The organisation of this event is being coordinated by the  Post-Growth Innovation Lab , a research group of the University of Vigo directed by the researcher Mario Pansera. Although the whole group is involved in the organisation of this event, for everything to go perfectly, we will need more people during the days of the conference who can support the organising team in different tasks. For this reason, we are creating a volunteer group in which we would like to count on people like youÂ ðŸ˜‰.</p>  <p> What will be the main functions of the volunteers?  <br>   <br> Collaborate in the  preparation of the spaces  in which the activities will be held, and in the signposting of the same.  <br>  <br> Preparing the rooms  for the different sessions and activities.  <br>  <br> Welcoming participants  and assisting in the registration process.  <br>  <br> Preparing materials  to be given to participants  <br> Providing  logistical support for coffee breaks and catering services .  <br>  <br> Informing and guiding participants  through the event venues  <br>  <br> Providing support in questions related to IT services  to the speakers/presenters of the sessions.  <br>  <br> Collaborate in dissemination and diffusion tasks  before and during the Conference.  <br>  <br> Collaborate in taking photographs and videos  during the conference for the website and social networks. </p>  <p> What will volunteers get in return?  <br>   <br>The most important is that it will  allow them to participate for free in an international scientific event  and to do so in an active and totally immersive way, by being part of the organisation of the event. But, in addition, they will have the following advantages:  <br> When they are not performing the tasks assigned to them, volunteersÂ  will be able to access all the activities of the Conference free of charge , without having to pay any registration fee.  <br>  <br> At the end of the event, they  will receive a document accrediting their participation in the Local Organising Committee  of the conference (this type of merit is useful in public calls for human resources and is highly valued when it comes to accessing certain jobs).  <br> They will also receive a  certificate of attendance at the Conference , similar to what the other participants will receive.  <br>  <br> 1.3 ECTS for University of Vigo students  who participate in the event, both as paying attendees and as part of the volunteer team.  <br> They will have  free access to the official meals of the Conference  during those days.  <br> They will receive a  t-shirt with an exclusive design created for the conference , which they will wear while doing volunteer work and keep as a souvenir at the end of the event.  <br> They will be able to  meet new people and be part of an international team . </p>  <p> What will be the working dynamic?  <br>   <br>Although the event will officially start on the afternoon of Tuesday 18 June (the opening day) activities will begin on  Monday 17 June , with a  PhD Symposium , the  International Degrowth Network (IDN) Assembly , and several non-academic activities taking place in the afternoon. The Conference will end on  Friday 21 June . The estimated timetable for the collaboration of volunteers will be as follows:  <br>  <br> Day 1 - Explanatory session by the organising team, team-building, and networking : date to be determined during the first half of June. It will be in hybrid modality (in-person and online)  <br>  <br>  <br> Day 2 - Assignment of tasks and start of the preparation of spaces : Friday 14 June. In-person modality (for those already in the city)  <br>  <br> Days 3-7 -Â Execution of tasks during the Conference : 17-21 JuneÂ   <br> Different groups will be organised and tasks will be distributed in such a way that each volunteer does not work for more than 5 hours a day and that all participants have the opportunity to attend the different sessions and activities of the Conference that may be of interest to them. The first shifts will start around 8.30 in the morning and the last will end around 21.30 in the evening. The volunteers' preferences and constraints will be considered when drawing up the timetables.</p>  <p> Who can participate as a volunteer? How can I sign up?  <br>   <br>Anyone of legal age can apply to join the team of volunteers. It is important, however, that  those who apply are willing to make the commitment and fulfill the tasksÂ  assignedÂ  by the Conference organising team. Participation in this activity will be a  great experience for the volunteers  and, as indicated in the previous section, the organisers will try to adapt the tasks and schedules to the needs and conditions of each volunteer, and to ensure that they can also enjoy the Conference activities as assistants, limiting the time spent working at the event. But for this to happen,  it is necessary that the people who form part of the volunteer team do so responsibly  and that, if they offer to participate, they are honest with their commitment. To apply to become a volunteer for the ESEE-Growth 2024 International Conference, please  fill in  this form  before 31 May 2024 . If you have any questions, please contact us at  comm_esee-degrowth2024@uvigo.gal .</p>
