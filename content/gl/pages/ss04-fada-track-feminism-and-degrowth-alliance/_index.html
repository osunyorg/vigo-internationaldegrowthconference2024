    SS04. FaDa Track: Feminism and Degrowth Alliance meets socialisation and commonisation in theory and practice.
  summary: >-
    <p>In our collaborative statement in the context of Covid-19, the Feminism and Degrowth Alliance (FaDA) called for” the socialization of all universal health care, the socialization of utilities, the decommodification of food, housing, medicines, education, and other basic services”. Several Feminist Degrowth scholar/activists stress the need to commonize care for a care-full and radical social and ecological transformation that goes beyond the mere redistribution of care work between the genders and grasp patriarchal capitalism at its root: The division of production and reproduction. In this track we aim to both set a common ground of what the socialization of the (re)production life means for feminist degrowth in theory and put the practice of activists and social movements in the center by creating a fruitful strategic dialogue.</p>
