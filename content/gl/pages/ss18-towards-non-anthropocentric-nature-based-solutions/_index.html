summary: >-
  Nature-based solutions (NBS) are promoted as a governance tool to tackle ongoing environmental and societal crises. While the importance of mimicking nature and applying participatory planning approaches in the NBS design and implementation are already well acknowledged, the intertwined dynamics of the social and the ecological affecting the NBS and its workability are still not well understood. Consequently, NBS are often considered as ‘technological fixes’ to environmental problems rather than “organic co-designs” that acknowledge the situational complexity and relational holism in support of community resilience and sustainability transformation. This special session calls for papers that contribute to ecological economics either by providing novel theoretical insights or exploring empirical findings with policy-making relevance. Special attention will be given to the practices of engaging multi-species assemblages in these processes, i.e. multi-species stakeholder approaches to give voice to non-humans in co-creating NBS.

        <p>Nature-based solutions (NBS) are promoted as a governance tool to tackle ongoing environmental and societal crises. While the importance of mimicking nature and applying participatory planning approaches in the NBS design and implementation are already well acknowledged, the intertwined dynamics of the social and the ecological affecting the NBS and its workability are still not well understood. Consequently, NBS are often considered as ‘technological fixes’ to environmental problems rather than “organic co-designs” that acknowledge the situational complexity and relational holism in support of community resilience and sustainability transformation. </p><p>This special session aims to explore research that unravels NBS from alternative theoretical and conceptual perspective with implications on NBS design and implementation. Special attention will be given to the practices of engaging multi-species assemblages in these processes, i.e. multi-species stakeholder approaches to give voice to non-humans in co-creating NBS. Special session calls for papers that contribute to ecological economics either by providing novel theoretical insights or exploring empirical findings with policy-making relevant lessons learnt on three main topics:</p><ol> <li>The opportunities and capabilities of all humans, also the most vulnerable and marginalized, to participate in collective action towards better functioning and fairer NBS;</li> <li>Integration of multi-species assemblages in NBS design and implementation;</li> <li>Alternative theories and methods to understand and define NBS.</li> </ol><ol> </ol>
