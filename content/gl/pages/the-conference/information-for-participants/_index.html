Some will be developed in English and others in Spanish/Galician. All the information about these activities can be found  here .   <br>  <br>  <br> There will be a permanent  information desk in the Escola de Enxeñería Forestal  from Wednesday 19 to Friday 21 June at  soto  floor.  <br>  <br> Several  volunteers will be available at the event venues . They will wear a blue T-shirt with the conference logo so that they can be easily identified.  <br>  <br> The  lunches will be only for those who have previously booked them.  They must be handed over to the persons in charge before access to the meal area. Due to high demand, no tickets will be available for sale on-site during the conference.  For those with no booked meal, there is a cafeteria in the Escola de Enxeñería <br>Forestal, and also in the Facultade de Comunicación (a bigger one). Out of the <br>campus you can find two supermarkets:  Mercadona  and  Froiz , both less than 15 <br>minutes walking.  <br>  <br> There will be several  free-use rooms  at the Escola de Enxeñería Forestal and Pazo da Cultura. Please, ask the volunteer team to use them if needed. </p>  <p> For presenters  <br>   <br> Presenters for track sessions (those starting with  T. ) and open special sessions (starting with  SS ) will have a  maximum of 15 minutes  for their presentations. This does not apply to artistic, interactive, or closed special sessions (in this case, please contact with the session organisers for specific details).  <br>  <br> Presenters should  download  their presentation  to the computer in the room  before the beginning of the session. No external computers can be connected, the computer in the room must be used.  <br>    <br> A  volunteer team member  will always be available to provide support if needed. If she/he is not in the room, please look for her/him in the adjoining rooms. Incidents should be reported to these persons, who will try to resolve them or, if this is not possible, they will contact the conference organisers.  <br>  <br> Presenters must be in the room for their session  10 minutes before the start  of the session.  <br>  <br>  <br> Each session has an assigned chair . If for any reason the chair is not present, the last presenter (or another of the presenters who wishes to do so) will become chair.  <br>  <br> The  order of presentations  within each session may be agreed between the presenters and the chairs before the start of the session.  <br>  <br> Some modifications have been made to the programme in recent weeks to try to meet the needs of some of the speakers.  Please  check the programme  before your session  to make sure you are clear about the day and time.  <br>  <br>  <br> We encourage speakers to use the  official conference template and typography  for their presentation. These files can be downloaded at the bottom of this page.  <br> </p>  <p> For chairs  <br>   <br> The  main functions  of the chairs will be:  - To agree on the order of presentations with the speakers - To ensure that speakers do not exceed the maximum time allotted for each presentation - To introduce the different presentations - To open and moderate the time for questions and answers.  <br> There will be  coloured cards  in each room that chairs can use if they wish to indicate to the speakers how much time they have left: green (more than 5 minutes available); orange (less than 3 minutes available); red (less than 1 minute available). Chairs  should be in the room for their session at least 15 minutes before  the start of the session. They should  ensure that speakers download their presentations to the room computer  before the start of the session. They will  agree on the order of the presentations  with the speakers before the start of the session. Some modifications have been made to the programme in recent weeks to try to meet the needs of some of the speakers.  Please  check the programme  before your session  to make sure you are clear about the day and time.

If she/he is not in the room, please look for her/him in the adjoining rooms.  <br>  <br> If changes are made to the room configuration , the furniture should be rearranged at the end of the session so it is as it was previously. </p>  <p> For special/interactive/artistic sessions organisers  <br>   <br> Organisers should be  in the room for their session at least 15 minutes before  the start of the session.  <br> A  volunteer team member will always be available  to provide support if needed.

The organisation will not provide additional equipment or support for these issues.  <br>  <br>  <br> If changes are made to the room configuration , the furniture should be rearranged at the end of the session so that it is as it was previously.  <br> </p>  <p> For poster presenters  <br>   <br> Each author must  bring her/his printed poster .  <br>  <br> Since thinking outside of conventional boundaries is an important theme for this conference,  we encourage participants to be creative in preparing the posters , without leaving aside rigor.   <br>  <br> Posters must be in vertical format, with dimensions  between 70-90cm wide x 100-120cm high .  <br>  <br> A  digital version of the poster must be sent before 11 June 2024 at 23.59 hours  to  review_esee-degrowth2024@uvigo.gal . These images will be uploaded to a gallery on the conference website.  <br>  <br> Before the start of the conference, authors will receive additional information on  how, when, and where to place their posters .  <br>  <br>  <br> Each author will have an assigned place for her/his poster  The days and times for the placement of posters will be:  - Wednesday: 9:30 - 10:30 or 13:30 - 14:30. - Thursday: 14:00 - 14:30. A volunteer team member will be there in these slots to provide material and help authors if needed. Outside these hours, material should be requested at the information desk.  <br>  <br> Authors will have the opportunity to explain their work and answer questions from the audience during the  posters sessions  on Wednesday 19 ( Posters session I ), Thursday 20 ( Posters session II ), and Friday 21 ( Posters session III ) from 14.30 to 15.00h. Authors are free to be with their posters on these days and times for as long as they wish.  <br>  <br> The  list of posters  can be found in the  Posters session I . </p>  <p> Wi-Fi connection  <br>   <br>To connect to the  Wi-Fi network IN ESCOLA DE ENXEÑERÍA FORESTAL  use the following data:   <br> User:  wifi2@uvigo.es  <br>  <br> Password: %Wi2024Fi%  <br> Select the network "personal" or "alumnos".</p>  <p> COVID information  <br>   <br>Since COVID is still ongoing, and conferences remain major spreader events, this is a plea for  anyone who might be feeling unwell the days of the conference to please care for themselves and the rest of the participants , and sit the conference out. We understand that this is a major ask given the trouble to travel to Pontevedra, but it is the minimum we can do to take care of one another and the most vulnerable among us.  We will try to have as many sessions as possible with open windows and plenaries will be in a tent.  We will count on masks and some tests  that will be available free of cost (on request at the information desk). But we don't want to put anyone, immunocompromised or not, in any risk of infection. Let's practice collective care!</p>  <p> Downloads  <br>   <br>Presentation template</p>  <p>Conference typography</p>

        <p>Since COVID is still ongoing, and conferences remain major spreader events, this is a plea for <b>anyone who might be feeling unwell the days of the conference to please care for themselves and the rest of the participants</b>, and sit the conference out. We understand that this is a major ask given the trouble to travel to Pontevedra, but it is the minimum we can do to take care of one another and the most vulnerable among us. </p><p>We will try to have as many sessions as possible with open windows and plenaries will be in a tent. <b>We will count on masks and some tests</b> that will be available free of cost (on request at the information desk). But we don't want to put anyone, immunocompromised or not, in any risk of infection. Let's practice collective care!</p>
