    SS10. Post-growth Academia – Towards the revival of academics as intellectuals of consequence
  summary: >-
    <p>Academia has been, and has the potential to be, a source of radical thinking and of contributions to a degrowth future. However, currently it is being pressed from all sides to do exactly the opposite, and resistance is ever harder to maintain. Many are being forced to use neoliberal and growth-oriented methods (e.g. building curricula through quantity of publications and grant acquisitions) even when their aim is to contribute to degrowth. It becomes a question of privilege who can do this, and the process severely narrows the sphere of action, making it dependent on charismatic engagement with the status-quo and quantity over quality. This session aims to proactively seek ways out of this alarming tendency, encouraging presenters and the audience to describe the problem in their context, but also to share geographical, social, political, organizational, economic, cultural, linguistic, technological or psychological means by which their field could help “rescue” academia.</p>

While irremediable climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, abject poverty, social exclusion and military conflicts are pressing humanity against a dark corner, university-based knowledge workers are encouraged or even forced to sell their research as a market commodity through hyperbolic language and self-aggrandizing statements to remain academically employable (Hyland and Jiang, 2021). Universities are risking to render themselves (and their employees) irrelevant stakeholders to the search for alternative futures as they focus on the mission of competing with each other for better positions in rankings and to attract the attention and sponsorship of funders whose primary goal is to guarantee the maintenance of the status quo through ever-increasing competitiveness, economic growth, and returns on investment (Boulton and Lucas, 2011; von Schönfeld and Ferreira, 2021). Academic work is experiencing a process that makes it increasingly fragmented, deskilled and intensified while surveillance mechanisms, supposedly ‘meritocratic’ hierarchies and precarity are accepted as the new normal for universities (Markovits, 2019; Ross and Savage, 2021; Sandel, 2020).
