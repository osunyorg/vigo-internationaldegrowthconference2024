summary: >-
  The materiality of extractivism and its impacts have been challenged through centuries by local and extra-local groups that defend land and water, and increasingly link their fight with alternative visions of development. Within extractivism we also observe a logic of taking without giving back that is also being challenged, even if not explicitly, by post-capitalist pluriverse proposals, eco-feminist ideas, as well as degrowth, advocating for a regenerative way of doing, feeling and acting.<br>The present panel aims at unifying in narrative and practical terms these two aspects of opposition towards extractivism, in order to craft a path towards a post-extractivist future that involves those fighting on the ground as well as the subjects of growth and its logics.
