        <p>Are you addicted to growth ? What does it actually mean to be addicted to growth ? And why is this</p><p>important ? The poster campaign "Addicted to Growth ?" on the streets of Pontevedra sparks</p><p>precisely these questions, preceding the annual conference on degrowth, which is hosted in</p><p>Pontevedra this year. The campaign is inspired by the book "Addicted to Growth, Societal Therapy</p><p>for a Sustainable Wellbeing Future" by Robert Costanza.</p><p>We know what it means to be addicted to alcohol, or smoking : you are craving for a drink or a</p><p>cigarette and you can't hold yourself back, even when you know it is not good for you. You're not in</p><p>control anymore. But how does that work with (economic) growth ? At the level of society ? We refer</p><p>to the aforementioned book by Costanza for details, here we ouline the idea.</p><p>Most of us will agree that our current economic activty is eventually destroying our habitat, much</p><p>like what happened to Easter Island. We contend that the economy as a whole is the sum of our</p><p>individual behaviours. And if our society is addicted to growth then this is because each of us is</p><p>addicted to growth. For this reason the campaign focusses on the question : what does it mean to be</p><p>addicted to growth ? On a personal level.</p><p>The answer to this question is not that hard. We may not have phrased it as addictive behaviour yet,</p><p>but we all know the answer. Addicted to growth means that you do things knowing, or at least</p><p>suspecting, that you should not do this in view of it's impact on our planet, the future and us. So let</p><p>us establish the way out :</p><p>Once you have realised that you are addicted to growth and you want to quit your addiction, we also</p><p>know how to do just that : envision your future life free of that addiction. So now we walk you</p><p>through the questions on the posters hoping to inspire you to form your vision of your future free</p><p>form your addiction to growth.</p>
