  <p>Many renewable-based large, medium and small energy projects are being pushed to achieve the energy targets and net-zero goals for decarbonization. The renewables are promoted as sustainable and green alternatives. However, studies have reported the failure of renewable-based projects to address questions of social and environmental justice, but the focus of these studies remained on large utility-scale projects. In this session, we wish to analyze the impact of small renewable energy projects in delivering just energy transition in rural areas of the global north and south. How green and just are these environmental and energy transition efforts? Does this top-down, market or state-led "environmentalization" increase local actors' vulnerability and marginality and affect their effective participation? Who finances and drives the community-led energy projects? How are inequality, inequity, access and marginality debated in small renewable projects? The session will re-socialize the overtly environmental debates on energy transitions from the rural perspectives.</p>

        <p>Governments, companies, communities and other hybrid organizations wish to achieve net-zero goals in a systematic manner over the coming decades to fulfil the decarbonization of economies (Papadis and Tsatsaronis, 2020; Li et al., 2022). As a  result, many non-renewable-based large, medium and small energy projects are being pushed to achieve the energy targets. Even though many such projects are promoted or celebrated as sustainable and green alternatives, over the years, many studies have reported the failure of renewable-based projects to address questions of social and environmental justice in many parts of the world (Yenneti &amp; Ray, 2016; Simón et al., 2019; Bedi, 2019; Sharma, 2020; Elmallah &amp; Rand, 2022). The focus of the majority of these studies is primarily on large utility-scale projects. </p><p>In this session, we wish to analyze the impact of small renewable energy projects in delivering just energy transition, which is emerging as a new site of contestation and accumulation of wealth and power (Sharma, 2020; Fathoni et al., 2021; Hernando-Arrese &amp; Rasch, 2022). Are small energy projects able to deliver a just energy transition and do not add to the vulnerability of the groups, settings and environment in which they are being planned or operated? Are the concerns of the local populace adequately addressed while planning such energy projects? What is the acceptance of these projects at the local level? How green and deep are these environmental efforts in bringing transformative change? Or are they a product of the ""environmentalization"" (Buttel, 1992) of the energy and developmental debate? Does this top-down and market or state-led ""environmentalization"" increase local actors' vulnerability and marginality and affect their effective participation in such transitions? Do community-led energy projects resist or perpetuate issues of justice and democratization of energy transition? Who finances and drives the community-led energy projects? Who makes the decisions and how are they made within these new social organizations? How are inequality, inequity, access and marginality debated among community-driven projects? </p><p>These small and medium-scale energy projects are often planned in rural areas of the global south or north. The rural populace, which often is not directly involved in a high-energy intensive and luxury-driven lifestyle (especially in the global south), contributed relatively less (historically and in per-capita terms) to the mega global environmental problems than other social groups. In such a context, the rural populace is paying double the price for a problem they had not directly contributed to. However, the environmental solutions are further going to make them exposed and susceptible to a new economic and social order, often not supportive of existing social order and uses. The papers in this session will explore the functioning and planning of small and medium-scale energy projects in the rural parts of the global north and south from the energy and environmental justice perspective. In the process, the session will reflect on the ways in which convergences and divergences can be found in the (un)just energy transitions taking place in different national and societal settings. The special session will attempt to re-socialize the environmental debates from the rural perspectives. </p><p>References:</p><ul> <li>Bedi, H. P.
