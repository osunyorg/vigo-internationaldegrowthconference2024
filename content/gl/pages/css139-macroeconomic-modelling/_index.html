    CSS139. Macroeconomic modelling for wellbeing and sustainability
  summary: >-
    <p>The session will explore new ideas from simulation models that study society–economy–environment interactions, and that can be used to assess policies. The session will bring together the modelling teams from three researcher projects (ToBe, WISE, and WISER). These projects responded to the same call by the European Union on “Public policies and indicators for well-being and sustainable development”. All aim to design a new economic paradigm beyond GDP metrics based on well-being, inclusion and sustainability. Ecological macroeconomics aims to provide macroeconomic analyses that link environmental impacts, social outcomes, and financial stability to inform discussions on how we can transform the economy to achieve prosperity within planetary boundaries. The ideas presented in this session are related to ecological macroeconomic models combining conventional macroeconomic variables with indicators of wellbeing and sustainability to assess policies from a multidimensional perspective, and to reveal the synergies and trade-offs inherent in the transition to sustainability.</p>

These models study society–economy–environment interactions, and can be used to assess various policy packages. The objective is to develop ecological macroeconomic models combining conventional macroeconomic variables with indicators of wellbeing and sustainability to assess policies from a multidimensional perspective, and to reveal the synergies and trade-offs inherent in the transition to sustainability. This session will present new ideas for modelling from three research projects that responded to the same call by the European Union on “Public policies and indicators for well-being and sustainable development”. The three projects are ToBe, WISE, and WISER. Each have about a funding of 3 million euro. All aim to design a new economic paradigm beyond GDP metrics based on well-being, inclusion and sustainability. This session will foster their interaction. The three projects are: 1) WISE: “Wellbeing, inclusion, sustainability and the economy” coordinated by the University of Leiden; WISER Project: “Well-being in a Sustainable Economy Revisited” coordinated by the Open Universiteit of Netherlands; ToBe: “Towards a sustainable wellbeing economy: integrated policies and transformative indicators”, coordinated by the University of Tampere. Ecological macroeconomics aims to provide macroeconomic analyses that link environmental impacts, social outcomes, and financial stability to inform discussions on how we can transform the economy to achieve prosperity within planetary boundaries. A critical idea is that the economy is embedded within society, which is in turn embedded within the biosphere. Economic processes are therefore analysed in terms of flows of biophysical resources and social outcomes — not just in terms of flows of money, as in conventional macroeconomic models. Conventional macroeconomic models typically adopt an optimisation framework with a single goal (e.g. GDP growth). However, GDP is increasingly being seen as a poor indicator of progress, which does not account for many of the things that people value most. Ecological macroeconomic models allow for multiple non-substitutable goals to be explored (e.g. sustainability, equity, and human wellbeing), and they are therefore ideally suited to the ambitious research agendas of both ecological economics and degrowth. In fact, these models include a wide range of indicators of wellbeing and sustainability, in addition to conventional macroeconomic variables. Therefore they allow policymakers to assess policies from a multidimensional perspective. The analysis of policy packages can provide important insights into the actual operationalisation of transformation. This session aims to present new research on ecological macroeconomic models that include a wide range of indicators of wellbeing and sustainability in addition to conventional macroeconomic variables. Such models are urgently needed to allow policymakers to assess policies from a multi-dimensional perspective and to reveal the synergies and trade-offs inherent in the transition to sustainability. The models can be used to assess different policy packages aimed at achieving a sustainable well-being economy. Having a vision of the desired end state in any modelled pathway is critical, and this depends on how one conceptualized a sustainable well-being economy. The policy packages considered often range from mainstream approaches, such as green growth, to socially progressive approaches, such as a Green New Deal, to more radical approaches, such as degrowth. The specific policies to be modelled  include ideas such as carbon taxes, investment in renewable energy, circular economy initiatives, redistributive taxes, working-time reduction, a universal basic income, and the provision of universal basic services. The conventional economic indicators that are modelled include income, employment, inequality, and productivity. These are combined with selected wellbeing indicators (e.g. life expectancy, life satisfaction, social inclusion, and gender equality) and sustainability indicators (e.g. CO2 emissions, energy use, material use, human appropriation of net primary production [HANPP], and land use). To truly capture sustainability, these model also compare social outcomes to the minimum thresholds required to meet people’s needs. There are a variety of different methods for including environmental variables within an economic model, but the most common is environmental extensions to input–output tables. This approach allows environmental variables to be linked to economic activity at the sectoral level. The environmental variables can further be compared to sustainability thresholds by using methods developed to downscale planetary boundaries to the national, or even sub-national, scale. Similarly, there are a number of different ways to incorporate wellbeing variables into a macroeconomic model. For instance, one can build upon the “provisioning systems” framework. This framework links social outcomes to biophysical resource use via a set of provisioning systems that include both physical systems (e.g. infrastructure and technology) and social systems (e.g. markets, government, culture). Recent research suggests that improving certain aspects of provisioning systems (such as public services, income equality, and democratic institutions) and abandoning others (such as extractivism) could enable countries to meet social objectives at much lower levels of energy use. Existing ecological macroeconomic models include PYMEDEAS, EUROGREEN, LOWGROW SFC, and DEFINE. They tend to be parameterised for a very limited geography (generally just a single country or region), while PYMEDEAS can be parameterised for three nested regions (the world, a region, and a country). These models are normally open source, and coded in Python, Stella, or Vensim.  They are system dynamics econometric models that has been cross-validated against other integrated assessment models, for example the ones used for IPCC scenarios. 4 presenters working on the EU projects ToBe, WISE, and WISER (15 minutes each, plus 30 minutes debate at the end)  <br> WISE: “Using input-output modelling for WISE analysis”.
