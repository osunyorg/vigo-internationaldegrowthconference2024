<p> Adrian Smith is Professorial Research Fellow in Technology and Society at the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. My research considers the politics of innovation for sustainability, and I've been fortunate to collaborate in that work with colleagues in Europe, Latin America, India and China    <br></p>
